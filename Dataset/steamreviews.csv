3409570,Bricks Smasher,189034666,76561199483805980,"Good, clean, silly fun! [i]Bricks Smasher[/i] feels like a combination of Robotron and Arkanoid. You're a little dude with a bat who runs around smacking balls into bricks that are baddies.    To assist you are power-ups like moving faster and having a bigger bat, along with enhanced balls such as a chicken that lays 'egg' mini balls, a cowboy ball that shoots, and a bomb that makes explosions on contact. As the levels progress, the 'bricks' get more numerous and tougher, and even start shooting back!    Completing a 'round' of play unlocks new characters with different starting abilities. I really enjoyed playing as them because they add a different challenge—and some are just a riot!    Overall, this game delivered exactly on the experience that I thought it would.😊 Bravo!",True,1,0,56,48,0,32,1740813811

This game is so simple but at the same time so hard, It's like Balatro but with more math and strategy and less art. If you suck at doing math you will probably suck at this game, so don't go leaving bad reviews because of your own capabilities. There are already multiple game modes with more to come in the future so I will be waiting for that in the full game, a suggestion I have for the future is some kind of 1v1 multiplayer mode with some sort of ranked mmr but that would only happen if there is a large active playerbase.

Yes, you have some abilities, but aside them being expensive, I'm talking about some effect that you can consistently use in every run. 2)Counter that shows maximum and minimum potential value of a card when you zoom in. It's fun to calculate stuff, but not when it's your 10's refresh of a shop and you are looking for a specific thing. 3)Stop the draws if you hit especially lucky combo.

The strategic mode on other hand is good and enjoyable, with all implemented mechanics it's engaging to play around with different cards and combos you could find. And i could'nt say that about abilities, yes there many of them but 85% of them are just ""repaint"" of first, and many abilities are super narrowly focused, litteraly unplayable with most of builds. For unimplemented modes i could only say that they seem interesting. The game has alot things to fix/balance/implement until it's release, and one of things that i would like to see is some sort of new characters, new decks to play with, wich will have diffrent starting cards (or ability) and of course new cards to mess around with.

Cons: - The wording of the ability cards can get a little muddy or confusing if you haven't discovered some things.

I thought it was going to be more like a hexagonal version of 2048, and while there are minor similarities, it is pretty different.  First off, turns are not about all the pieces moving in one direction, but picking one piece and moving it.  Second off, it works on multiples of four, so half you pieces can never merge with the other half. Fours become sixteens becomes sixty-fours, etc., while eights become thirty twos which become one hundred and twenty eights.  That said, it is still fun and clever.  For starters, as long as you can make groups of four, no new pieces are added to the board, as soon as you cannot, five more are added to the bottom. You can see what numbers are coming, which is a little useful, but near as I can tell, placement is random into empty spaces. It can help you decide which not matching move to make, as newly dropped units will merges groups of four if it matches.  Note that if you can make a larger group, a set of five or more, they all merge, but the total remains four times the amount on one of the tiles. This still opens up more of the map, so that is still a good thing.  There are also two tactical actions you can take, shuffle and a bomb which takes out one space. These cost you energy, which defines how many moves you can make before the game ends.  Making a match will add one energy, so eventually you will run out.  I get the impression that faster actions might give you more energy in a combo, I need to experiment more with this.  There are a few oddities, for example most of the time the four will merge into the space where you placed the last tile, but not always, not sure why.  All in all though, I had a lot of fun, and easy two thumbs up. Thinking about maybe making a guide? If you want a basic guide, drop a comment here under my review.",True,0,0,177,76,0,668,1737807408

3408570,Harmony Of Fear,192308729,76561198152397923,"What’s Good: 1. Plot The story kicks off with a teacher and her students preparing for a musical. At first, things feel pretty normal—you’re just doing everyday tasks and chatting with students. But as you go deeper, the stakes slowly rise and unexpected stuff starts happening. It really pulls you in, and I found myself getting more and more curious about where things were headed.  2. Atmosphere The atmosphere in this game is top-notch. Right from the start, there’s this uneasy vibe that never really goes away. Your movement is intentionally slow, so you can’t just rush through areas—which makes going through the villa feel tense every time. The low visibility keeps you on edge, constantly looking over your shoulder. And the soundtrack? Super creepy and fits the mood perfectly.  What’s Not So Good: 1. Performance For a game that isn’t super graphically demanding, the performance is rough. I’m running it on an i7-8750H with a GTX 1050 Ti—definitely above the minimum specs—but still only getting around 15–20 FPS. I tried lowering the settings, but it didn’t help much. The choppiness did mess with the experience a bit (though weirdly, it kinda added to the creepiness sometimes).  What Could Be Improved: 1. Map System You do get used to the layout as you play, but the first few missions can be a bit frustrating since you don’t really know where anything is. A simple static map would go a long way in helping new players find their way around without wandering aimlessly.  Final Thoughts: For an indie horror game, this one really nails what matters most: story and atmosphere. Yeah, the performance could be better, and it could use a map, but I still had a great time with it. If you’re into horror games and can overlook some technical hiccups, I’d say give it a shot.

There will be feedback/updates to take into account to perfect it and make it better!   Updated: Was able to give pastries for cafe customers [put them on the register table and hit space]. I thought you would have to give change like you do the register, but they don't so you just need to grab the food and hit space. I'm still playing through the demo, enjoyable so far.  Some notes:  The register doesn't have $20 bills or 10 cent coins, which made it annoying to give change (other sim games I've played have always had these two items). It threw me off a lot and I kept giving incorrect change often.  It would be helpful if there's maybe a pop-up on big change return mistakes -- for instances I accidentally didn't give someone $96.84 in change -- whoops. Maybe if it's $10 or more in disparity, there's a confirmation box? And maybe have an option to turn this feature on/off because I could see that bugging some people if they don't care about mistakes.  I would love the ability to set specific prices rather than just a percentage. This way I can make items in the store a more even number for easier change / cash.  It would also be nice to see an order history for the items you purchase ahead of time.  Could not move furniture!! That MUST be updated as it's impossible to rearrange the store.   It would be great if there was a way to open up the tutorial -- I didn't see a hotkey anywhere, I think it goes away when you open the store for the day.  Great Lo-Fi (chill) music in the game so far, I like that part, would be great if they had more for variety. The graphics are a step up from other market sim games and is pleasing to look at. The third person POV is too close up and would be great slightly zoomed out a bit more.  Would be interested to see how this game develops but it's definitely very early stages (since the game isn't out yet). If they put effort and updates to this game it could have potential to be great. It is concerning that the demo is a struggle if this game is supposed to come out within a month.

However, the game in it's current state is quite buggy and broken in many ways and there are a lot of problems even with the mechanics that function as intended.  Some examples of this are; - The hitboxes of NPCs and certain objects in the world are huge for no reason and can block entire paths/stairs until you find the perfect invisible gap to squeeze through. This occurs quite often in the game and is very frustrating, often leading to reloading a save because you get outright stuck sometimes. - The combat is frustratingly repetitive and a lot of enemies have far too much health, making most random encounters boring slogs that don't really add much to the game. If the combat was more balanced or better yet, revamped completely this would be a far better game. Once I realized I could turn off random encounters. I began to enjoy the game a lot more. - Audio from one line of dialogue overlaps with the next when you skip through dialogue. - Inconsistencies with what words a character will ask you to translate vs what words the game actually prompts you to enter. - The 'speak' function to enter words using a microphone does not work well at all. - Sometimes the text will suddenly change to French for a sentence or two mid-conversation, before switching back to Spanish.  - A lot of spelling errors. These are just the problems I can think of from the top of my head I'm sure there are more I am forgetting. All of that aside the game does have potential and some charm.

I am a big fan of first person puzzle platformers, and have played many in the genre since the gold standard set by Portal then by Portal 2. Many of these games have been good in various ways, but lacking in other ways. Many have been duds in major ways. A handful have been quite excellent. ChromaGun 2 (demo) really nails it though: it has challenging puzzles, but no so challenging that you're stuck for too long. It has platforming/environmental puzzles.  It has (multiple) cool visual styles. It has decent sense of humor, and lines delivered by  professional voice actors. It has hidden secrets. It has good performance.  It has many nice little touches that remove annoyances if you make a mistake. An example of what I mean is that there was one section in the demo that is almost pure platforming of about 10 or so jumps. However, after every (one or two) tricky jump(s), you can flip a switch to allow you to redo that jump in an easier way should you fall and have to redo that section. So the penalty for falling off the platform is not as bad as having to redo all the tricky jumps again which would be a bit frustrating. It's like the developers got together and asked themselves, ""what are some of the little annoyances in typical first person puzzle platformers games, and what can we do to eliminate them, so that what's left is pure fun?"" Really appreciate that! Also, the jumps in that section weren't even that that tricky. I dislike it when in some games you have to run and time pressing the jump key oh-so-precisely so that you just make it across a gap. Then it takes you 5 tries to nail it. To me, that doesn't count as fun. Chromagun 2 demo did not have anything like that.  The puzzles are clever, creative and fun.

3408840,ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard Demo,188570425,76561198135518501,"ChromaGun 2 (Demo!) is a puzzle platformer which surprised me with a good story and challenging puzzles, especially for a demo. Often enough, the story and the complexity of the puzzles in a demo are reduced to a bare minimum, not showing too much to make people buy the game. In this case however, the demo is perfect for exploring what the game is about. It even has enough replay value due to achievements and collectibles.  The demo teases a great and deep story which can't hide behind other great puzzle platformers, most notably Portal. While the story shares some similarities with Portal (“Testing”), it is clearly not a clone. In the story, the player is guided through different dimensions with very distinct styles. Each dimension has its own sections with puzzles to solve, and a different narrator. Judging from the demo, it seems like there's not much choice the player has about the story; there are no branches, no different endings. It would be easy to spoil more parts of the story, but it's even easier to say: Just play it—it's worth it!  Gameplay-wise, it looks very similar to the first part ChromaGun, though I can't really tell as I haven't played it. The player has the ability to color specific plates and objects in the level using the Chroma Gun. These colored plates will behave like magnets for various gameplay objects with the same color. The challenge is to color the correct plates in the correct order to manipulate the level so we can finish this section and continue.  The colors themselves are oriented around three primary colors (red, yellow, blue) and their secondary colors (orange, green, magenta). Those secondary colors can be achieved by mixing the primary colors accordingly.  It's worth noting that at some point the plates and objects are “overcolored” and just turn black, deactivating any magnetic behavior. This, and the fact that some objects can't change their color, is used as an additional puzzle challenge.  Throughout the demo there are challenges of varying degrees. While some challenges can be solved very easily by just looking around and coloring two objects, others require careful thinking and also thinking outside the box. One challenge even let me pause playing to continue at a later point. Yes, the demo is not just made for a single testing session—you can enjoy it multiple times!  The graphics of the game are kept simple, there's no over-realism or hyper-realism. The image is clear to read, there are no strange lighting artifacts or blurring happening. Various effects and animated objects fill the otherwise almost sterile levels with life. And did I notice some very well known Niagara effect somewhere?  Other than that, it's hard to judge the game graphics based on the demo and in total. Each dimension has its own art and graphical style, one going into a more organic direction and the other looks like a comic. Each style however looks very well thought out and matches the dimension.  As a game developer, it would be quite interesting to take a look behind the scenes and see how they achieved those different styles. And of course, I noticed a few things that I'd have done differently.  In total, the ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard demo is a wonderful demo that showcases what a demo in 2025 can be. It gives a good taste of the story, and has a lot of replay value for a demo by making use of achievements and collectibles. The gameplay covers a nice range of easy and complex puzzles, I sure hope they can find the right balance in the final game. Pixel Maniacs, good job!",True,1,0,275,160,0,2,1740309012

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] The main menu could use a bit of polish. You can play in either Streamer Mode or Adult Mode. The Instructions option turns on game hints when you play, which are as clear as mud.  There are 100 different women to unlock, you have to unlock them in order. When you select a woman you get a plane animation taking you to some place in the world. This really only affects the background of the current challenge.  You get a, from what I could determine, random amount of mana, from two to ten. Drawing a card costs one mana. Playing a card also costs one mana. You damage your opponent when you attack a space that is not occupied by a card.  My basic strategy was to keep all of the card slots full, and using any extra mana to put cards in my hand. There didn't seem to be a limit to the number of cards you could have in your hand.  Cards are very basic. In general, the attack is half of the cards hit points, and they all cost one mana. There are no special cards. Card values seem to be random, within a set. My first battle I had 1,000 hit points and attacks were higher values. The next two battles I had 100 hit points and the maximum attack was 10.  [h1]The Gallery[/h1] The Gallery is accessed from the title page. All of the women are unlocked in the Gallery when you start. The Gallery is like a very, very, very, long corridor that you walk down. The icon of the woman is on your right and the card image is on your left. You can only pan your vision left and right.

FREE to the Public, again over on my Patreon :)   Before I start this review, I would like to extend my thanks to the Digitaly Arts team, for joining me on stream to discuss/ reveal their project Time Breaking: Dino Breach. I loved meeting every single one of you and I'm super excited to see how you develop the game further!   REVIEW:   I want to start this by saying that Dino Crisis will always hold a special place in my heart. Since a very young age I have enjoyed many retro classics at the time of their releases and Capcoms Dino Crisis is one of them.   My first impressions loading up this demo, is the subtle nods to the Dino Crisis franchise. Time Breaking: Dino Breach also has a ""This Game contains explicit violence and gore"" load up screen and behind this message is scene from Time Breaking: Dino Breach. For those of us who lived through and experienced Dino Crisis at the time of its release, this Demo is an adrenaline fuelled shot of nostalgia, and to be honest, I'm all for it.   There are many Dino Crisis Easter Eggs dotted throughout this demo. I have enabled comments, so please feel free to leave a comment telling me which DC/DC2 Easter Eggs YOU have found! To list a couple that I've found, are for example; the DDK like puzzle for the hacking machine (if you know, you know), numerous letters and notes with some character names paying homage to some characters called the same name in DC (Gale) DC2 (Paula, David). I wont list much more as I don't want to give too much away.  Being able to play a video game again where you can slide a bookcase to reveal an entrance or a cart to reveal an unlocked door, is something I didn't realise I missed in modern day video gaming. Its a simple mechanic, yet its one I've come to realise, I've sorely missed. The music and sound composure is another take away aspect of the Time Breaking: Dino Breach experience. Being able to explore the facility with violent rain hammering against the glass, the spine shivering, hair raising hiss of the Raptors when they start to close in on you, followed by the music, dialling panic mode all the way to 100. [DA] Carlo and the team have done an amazing job so far in creating an immersive, unfamiliar, yet familiar experience.   The Time Breaking: Dino Breach UI is both beginner/advanced player friendly. Its clear to understand whilst also complimenting the overall player experience. Those of you that have played DC/DC2 will appreciate the simplistic UI design, whilst also noticing a Digitaly Arts twist. The sounds and music accompanying the UI and its navigation sounds add additional immersion, the UI boasts clear inventory item placers, the amount of those items you currently own and if you're like me who's new to PC Gaming, controls on how to navigate and exit the inventory menu are located at the bottom of the screen.    Kate's character model is one that doesn't look out of place especially regarding modern day video game characters. Her voice actor did an incredible job portraying Kate's character and emotional state during certain parts of the demo. I personally cannot wait for the release of the Full game.   ONE THING THAT ""BUGS"" ME  Reflecting on my time playing the demo, there is just one thing that bugs me slightly. The handgun/pistol fire rate I feel needs to be tweaked. If memory serves, I think that Capcom & their Dino Crisis/ Resident Evil handgun/pistol fire rate was similar, however I feel that pistols in games beyond the DC era have increased their fire rate, except for heavy handguns like the Desert Eagle for example.    Personally I'd rather have less damage output but faster fire rate regarding handguns. Noticing how the Raptors respond to gunshots i.e; staggered / stunned, the handgun could be used as a stun and move gun regarding its standard ammo. However, the handgun could become a more formidable weapon when you craft/find its FMJ ammo variant. To provide balance and QoL (Quality of Life) you could make FMJ craftable ONLY,  and spread out the FMJ ingredients throughout the game in lesser quantities. Ideally you could find the ingredients closer to boss battles or areas which are considered more difficult in the game.   Other than the fire rate, I don't have any other criticisms. The demo has played smoothly for me and I haven't experienced any bugs in the demo so far. I've currently replayed the demo several times whilst recording for my YouTube video breakdown of Time Breaking: Dino Breach   That being said, The Time Breaking: Dino Breach Demo is a promising, nostalgia driven teaser brought to us from a talented & passionate team of devs!   Those of you who may be reading this, I urge you to try the demo out for yourselves. Again feel free to comment on my review, your thoughts on what I've highlighted/ your experiences of the Demo. Like I stated above, I am currently creating a YouTube video on my Time Breaking: Dino Breach experience and any comments on my review may be used.    Thank You for reading.

The isometric view style is a nice touch and does a lot to add to the atmosphere. I did notice a bunch of bugs with the inventory and menus but no doubt they will be fixed in time. The inventory management, map, storage and save system being that of previous Capcom games is a big win. The ambient sound design and score is great but the voice acting is a bit flat and hopefully just a placeholder. The writing on the notes is a little strange too as though all the notes were written to be read by someone that doesn't know anything about the facility or the people involved. It comes across as very out of place and silly. Lastly the gun play felt a little off and slow in both dinosaur reaction and actually firing the weapons.   That said, as someone that has been wishing for a new Dino Crisis since the early 2000's this looks to be the most promising attempt at filling the void I have seen.

I have counted a couple: left tab, right mouse, Key F - i think its a lot of variety and inconsistent. Would be nice and more intuitive to have one master key to exit any prompt, menu. - Minor detail but in the inventory while rotating the model of the shutgun and handgun, the models do not rotate around the middle of the screen. Or at least the shotgun for sure as it can go out of frame while looking at it. - Joypad support would be appreciated but maybe thats self explanatory and planned already. - Maybe a slight feedback on the sound design: it was cool to somewhat hear the raptor that was outside while Kate is inside the building but in the outside area if the raptor is alove on the balcony and Kate is running on the ground floor outside you can still hear the raptor with the same volume as it was in right front of her. So if the player is further away i think the sound should be more still not to confuse the player of the enemy placement.

In order to patch the game you must go to Kagura Games website and download the exe file to update the steam version with the patch. Without the patch, the game is a buggy mess. With broken animations, and softlocks to name a few, but with the price you pay for, you shouldn't have to accept these issues. So the remainder of this review is going over the patched version.    I enjoy this game, the deck building feels fun and rewarding when you find good synergies. The pixel art here is phenomenal and breathes a lot of personality into the Succubi and other monster girls you fight. For those that aren't after a difficult challenge, there is an easy mode to help you.     If you are in this for just the H scenes, these are very well animated and have a good variety. The music in the game is what you would probably expect from a game like this. It helps you get settled in, but it is pretty easy to hear that they don't loop it very smoothly. This is a small gripe. There is also plenty of reason to do more runs besides just trying to beat it. As you encounter events or creatures, they get added to your gallery for your viewing pleasure. There could be a few QOL improvements, like the ability to skip through dialogue. But what is here is very well put together.     Honestly, if you like deck building rouge-likes and are after great H scenes. You can't go wrong with this title. Just don't expect the depth of some of the more popular deck builders like Slay the Spire and Balatro.     Just remember to download the patch from Kagura Games Website if you buy this.

His ultimate fate is determined by player choices—will he fulfill his mission, or be permanently enslaved by the succubi?[/td] [/tr] [/table]  [table] [tr] [th]🏆[b]Verdict:[/b][/th] [/tr] [tr] [td] Succubus Forest delivers exactly what it promises—a satisfying roguelike deck-builder with a strong erotic focus. While it may not offer the deepest strategic complexity compared to genre giants like Slay the Spire, it compensates with a streamlined, engaging gameplay loop and a well-integrated Lust Gauge system that keeps combat exciting. The deck-building aspect is solid, and though it lacks multiple archetypes, relic choices allow for varied strategies. Whether you're optimizing your deck for survival or intentionally walking into seduction traps, every run presents a fun challenge.  The game’s biggest draw is its pixel-art erotic content, which is both well-animated and seamlessly woven into gameplay. Unlike many adult games where H-scenes feel disconnected, here they happen in combat, creating a unique risk-reward dynamic. The monster girls are beautifully designed, each with distinct seduction techniques that make encounters memorable. The variety of animated scenes, from pixel-art battle animations to full-screen CGs, ensures there’s plenty to enjoy visually. The breast physics and fluid motion add extra appeal, making the experience feel polished.  Of course, the game has some limitations—it lacks permanent progression, meaning each run starts from scratch, and while the H-gallery is a great addition, a full unlock option would have been welcome. There’s also no voice acting, which could have added extra immersion. However, for what it sets out to do, Succubus Forest succeeds. If you're looking for a well-executed erotic roguelike with high-quality animations and enjoyable deck-building mechanics, this is an easy recommendation.

3408020,Succubus Forest,189025444,76561198099227311,"[h1]Review [/h1] [h2]✒️Overview [/h2] Succubus Forest is a short but entertaining deck builder with roguelike elements, that tells a simple tale of heroism in which the protagonist must follow the mission of the goddess to defeat the leader of the succubus that is at the end of the dungeon of the Succubus Forest. The task is not an easy one, since besides having to overcome huge amounts of enemies to get there, he will also have to endure the constant sexual temptations that the succubus provoke (showing him her breasts, rubbing against him, flashing panties, etc.).  [h3]🎮 Gameplay [/h3] For those familiar with the roguelike/deck-building genre, this game, like many others, will be very familiar to Slay the Spire, since the interface is similar, sharing many mechanics, although in the end Succubus Forest ends up being simpler, since besides the gameplay it also focuses on sexual content with numerous animations. For starters, this title does not have different heroes or starting decks, but is limited to only 1, and the only difference between the beginning of one game and another is that you can choose 1 of 3 ""relics"" that give you a bonus for the entire run, which can help you orientate yourself on what type of deck archetype to create (defensive with armor, combo with low cost, powerful cards but high energy cost, etc.). Another notable difference with respect to Slay the Spire is that in this game you cannot choose between different paths, instead this game follows a system ""on rails"", where although the events are random (fights, treasures, encounters, recovery zones, improvement zones, shop and bosses) the game itself dictates them and it is up to you to overcome them. For the rest, the gameplay is not much different from other similar games, starting with a basic deck that you can improve with cards you get by winning battles or finding them in encounters. In battles, you start with 3 Energy (which can be increased with Relics), draw 5 random cards from your deck, and there are Attack, Armor, and Skill cards. The only difference between Succubus Forest and other games is that during fights, in addition to a life bar, you have a lust gauge that increases when enemies perform erotic attacks on the protagonist, which not only give him a debuff, but also increase his lust. This gauge is important because the lust level is maintained between fights, and when it is full, the enemies can rape the protagonist until they suck all the life out of him if you fail to overcome the QTE that occurs during the act. It is worth mentioning that although this game follows roguelike mechanics of randomness and multiple attempts, the protagonist does not get any permanent bonus, so whether it is your first game or your tenth game will always have the same difficulty, so you will depend entirely on your skill and luck to choose cards or ""relics"" to overcome the 50 floors of the dungeon, a task that is not at all easy [spoiler] considering that the final boss has two phases with lots of life and debuffs[/spoiler]. Fortunately, the game has an easy mode where you get bonuses of strength and defense, which makes the adventure much easier if you just want to enjoy the sexual content.  [h3]🔞Sexual content[/h3] [h3]Note: You need to install the +18 patch from the publisher's page or you will not see any sexual content. *You can add me if you need help.[/h3] This game has a decent amount of sexual content with 30 animated sex scenes, 21 of which occur in full battle with pixel art the size of the character's sprite, and 9 pixel art ""HD"" that occur in full screen and are unlocked in special events during the game (it is worth mentioning that because you depend on luck for these to occur, so it is impossible to unlock them all in a single game). The quality of the sexual animations of both girls and HD, frankly, is exquisite, the movements are fluid, erotic, plus they offer a variety of sexual positions, which is quite lustful. Of course, the best animations are HD, because you can see in more detail the sensual body of the succubus (uncensored) without losing that attractive pixel art, although the negative is that they do not have a very high duration, since they are mostly loops where you decide when the protagonist ejaculates. In terms of sexual fetishes, given the nature of the title, most of the content is focused on female domination or reverse rape, so the scenes you see have to do with services of all kinds, blowjobs, handjobs, footjobs, assjobs, boobjobs, breast rubbing, flashing, breast-feeding and threesomes. There are also traditional vaginal sex scenes, although they are in the minority. Where there is more variety to satisfy different tastes is in the girls, since in addition to the typical sucubus with huge tits, there are also monster girls such as slimes, bunny girls, maids, cow girls, cat girls, plant girls, etc. So it's easy to find one that suits your personal taste. This game has a replays gallery where you can see both combat animations and special events, but unfortunately there is no option to fully unlock it even after finishing the game, so if you want to see all the content of this type, you will have to play several runs.  [h2]💭Conclusion[/h2] In a few words, this is a short game, but it is a game that satisfies both in terms of gameplay and onanism. While it is true that they are not as complex as other erotic deck builder themed games I have played, such as X-Angels,  Take Me To The Dungeon!!! or others, as there are not many different archetypes to create, nor do you have to strategize beyond building your deck. However, this is offset by the sexual content, which is not only limited to sexual reward scenes or events, but also occurs during combat, which helps to keep your little friend ""awake"" if you prefer to play this game one-handed. So with that said, I definitely recommend this game for those looking for both gameplay and sexual content, if you also have a taste for pixel art like I do, this is definitely an instabuy as you won't regret it.

It's a short and sweet game about finding a killer's confession on their PDA by cracking various codes. You've got a growing library of information on various types of codes and how to decipher them.  The puzzles aren't too tricky and feel like basic introductions to each type of problem. You'll probably need a bit of paper and a pencil to solve a couple of the codes, but it's nothing that will leave you lost. I do find it a bit too hand-holdy with how obvious many of the puzzles are. It's very clear when you have the information you need for each puzzle and that results in a very linear experience with no major ""AHA!"" moments.  It takes about an hour to complete and is totally free, so you lose nothing by taking a shot and I found it charming. If anything, I just hope that this is evolved and expanded into some kind of full-length work similar to Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, because I think there's a lot of gold that can be mined from a concept like this if fleshed out.

The gameplay itself is both somewhat educational if you're unfamiliar with cyphers, and exremely entertaining to figure out, it really feels like a good mystery that isn't too vague, but doesn't hold your hand either. If you like puzzle games of this sort, where a lot of the solving and effort is actually done outside of the game (In your head, on paper, etc.), this is for you.  There were only 3 things I disliked, 1) The font size, on some screens it was hard to read. 2) I was able to unlock book 4 before book 3, which made me pursue the tougher puzzle first, I got stuck here for a while because of that, and the fact I'd never solved that type of cypher before. and 3) Lack of narrative, there could be a little more to the story, like a wall of text at the beginning just saying who you are and why you care about this case, it would take very little effort but add a lot to the game I feel.

She's the first true assassin we've gotten since Nuxia, and she's a concept I feel is done right. She needs one single change to be perfect, and then she'll be a solid addition to the roster.  Khatun is a deflect master hero. Her kit revolves around either getting her into her deflect or pressuring enemies with soft feints to bait a deflect. Any recovery you have you can soft feint into a long forward dash. During this dash you can either throw incredibly fast lights, throw a unblockable that pins, dodge away to the sides, or automatically deflect any attack that lands on you and confirm that same unblockable from earlier. The major issue with her effectiveness is that the pin does [b] NOT [/b] go through hyper armor, and is how she gets a majority of her damage.   Aside from the run, you can do a lot from the soft feints. She can feint heavies into a bash, lights and another heavy. Her lights after a run can chain into these soft feint heavies as well, plus the run itself has almost no recovery frames when you finish it. Meaning if someone tries to wait out your forward dash mixup you can parry or dodge anything they try and do right after it.  She just has so many interesting match ups that make me really enjoy her. If a character uses a side dodge bash to try and punish a recovery cancel run that you do, you can cancel that recovery cancel into a side dodge and punish it with your own dodge attack. Is an enemy doing empty dodges on your soft feint lights because you can recovery cancel into deflect? Soft feint into a heavy instead and her tracking will punish them good.

The character has an auto-deflect, being a 'deflect master' and has an interesting playing style. The problem? Their deflect is a multi-hit combo pin that is interrupted by hyper armor.   There's a lot of characters, popular ones too, that have easy access to hyper armor. So much so that if Khatun tries to do their deflect, they actually lose against someone just doing a regular attack combo. This invalidates the deflect and read.  This is not a problem for full block characters, as those stop hyper armor attacks (kyoshin, conqueror, etc). Khatun does not. If you deflect highlander's light, which normally on a full block character would grant you the upper hand, you'll instead be hit by a high damage hyper armor attack.  Here's hoping they will change it, which they might, but this sadly goes to show that this was either designed by an AI or someone who does not know how basic mechanics within For Honor interact.",False,15,1,0,,0,28,1737917945

Here’s what I liked: •	An interesting setting and great design that conveys the right atmosphere of heat, sweat, and napalm. There’s also a balance between the seriousness of the overall theme and the fun brought to life by the inhabitants through sound and textual elements. •	Impressive performance considering the developers' limited resources and workforce constraints. I was pleasantly surprised—no critical bugs, lags, or frame drops. The game runs excellently. •	Significant variability in how each level can be completed. Every mission can be approached differently, using various supplies and perks. Additionally, the procedural generation ensures that each new playthrough feels unique, both in terms of difficulty and enjoyment. •	Personally, I like that the game is hardcore and doesn’t go easy on players, but at the same time, I found everything fairly intuitive, with no difficulties in getting used to it. The survival elements are well-implemented, forcing you to think through every action and manage resources wisely. What’s missing or could be considered drawbacks or potential issues: •	Currently, the game lacks a variety of melee and firearms. The variety primarily comes from resources or secondary weapons (grenades, C4, etc.). •	At the moment, gameplay consists only of completing separate missions that are not interconnected. This might deter players who prefer a storyline or progression in their games. However, this is just a demo, so this might be implemented by release or in the future if the game gains enough traction. Overall, I recommend trying this game regardless of whether you’re a fan of the genre or have never played such games before. I believe the game deserves attention. ",True,4,0,138,138,0,1,1736011017

Recommendations for full release * Full adjustable UI for a more vertical setup. * Easier UI for Programs and the program box, something like a card book would go a long way. * The ability to know where a quest is going to be before I start one so I can multitask. * Somethings with the UI are not intuitive, for example I didn't know I could hatch eggs in the program box, and I'm not sure I can delete extra programs.

Something without a internet connection that uses a image file so people can bring their custom ones. * Have a virtual pet companion that can be raised and evolved as you play, with them being equipable to your BIT to provide enhancements.  V-Pet Ideas * The companion V-pet could grow similar to games like ""Monster Tale"", ""Sonic Adventure 2 Battle"", ""Digimon World"" or even the ""Vital Hero"" toy. * The V-Pet should not punish the player for not playing as the game is already designed to be idle, like how when your away from the Chao Garden in Sonic Adventure nothing bad happens. * A V-Pet dex to encourage the player to try different ways of raising their pets to collect them all would be cool.",True,2,0,1211,975,0,30,1742492414

Berserk B.I.T.S sorta accomplishes that vision, in it's own neat little way!  As this is an idle game, most of the time player input is rarely needed. Most of the time you'll just be watching things happen, the only time you actually need to do things is when you need to drop your Bit onto a section of the map, renovate it's home and also feeding your Bots (which is important since they give you your battle chips) and of course reading E-mails (both in-game and IRL if you so choose LOL)  The biggest thing about this however, is the Custom Bit function. As you can imagine this lets you bring your own little cyber-buddies to life or even characters from other games. It's easy as hell if you've worked with sprites or just pixel art animations in general and has plenty of space for Bits of all shapes and sizes. But it could definitely allow for more customisation, which could be probably achieved with the bitconfig file since it's really not doing much other than telling the game ""hey, files are here"" and if the game gets Steam Workshop Support later on after its release, it could make sharing Custom Bits easier, and allow for more stuff like a save file icon, additional frame settings for specific animations, a Custom Bit Name so the game doesn't just say ""BIT"" in the corner, maybe customised dialog for to make them more personalised, and of course custom bit device colors to match.

The cost to create helpers are quite high, and you really can't be too idle until you create an Auto Shaker helper to passively collect money & hearts to heal your B.I.T. Your bots/pets (which generate battle chips) also create a lot of poop which can be a hassle to clean up without the cleanup helper, and cluttered game windows can cause the game to freeze for a split second when you attempt to click something. The data bit & treasure chest costs to create these two helpers should definitely be lowered to make the starting experience smoother.  A small detail that should absolutely change is what your B.I.T. does during exploration when faced with opening a Mystery Data or moving forward while you're idle. Your B.I.T. should always go for the Mystery Data. There's no reason for it to skip opportunities to mine desperately needed data bits. It's another minor annoyance that keeps you from really being idle in the beginning.  As is, Berserk B.I.T.S is alright.

It is a sort of Idle Game style one and has elements from Animal Crossing-ish games too. Now as an idle game, thankfully it isn't like those countless idle games you see on the App Store that are nearly impossible to get far in without paying money, in fact it has zero microtransactions (and from the looks of things, it will probably stay that way in the final version). The Coin Generator Programs, though requiring occasional shaking (unless you get the auto-shake upgrade), can handle that for you. Note it is kinda grindy, don't expect this to be a game to speed-run.   Most of the game sort of plays itself and you just have to feed your chip crafters and know when to use your health programs. It's meant to work in the background and does pretty well most of the time for that. Another cool thing, there's an in-game sprite editor so you can make your own custom character (think like Minecraft), I always love those. From the looks of things, it might get additional updates and upgrades as it goes on. I kinda can see it working well on the IPhone App Store too.   Some things I want to see in the final version. -Make there a little more control over your character. Most of the time he doesn't dodge hits and I just have to take the blow and hope my Health Programs and Health chips can let me outlast them. -Add other upgrades besides level ups.

During exploration they'll run into battles and automatically fight and give you EXP, there's also a chance at finding items to use in automating the game and potentially Eggs to unlock ""programs"" that'll give you battle chips so you can take on bosses! You'll also eventually unlock missions which are timed fights that'll give you a reward if you complete it.  You'll always be earning money from doing exploration / battles but also you can buy programs like a money bot that when shaken (not stirred) will give you some extra cash. As you improve your levels and items you can buy automation bots like an auto shaker and auto feeder for your programs to help the idle nature keep going.   Alongside the fighting there is the massive customisation home area. You can decorate it with plenty of items in a style that suits you. All entirely cosmetic but it's going to sit around your desktop so you want it to look cool.   All of this is packaged in a really cool looking UI that's looks like a PET and based on the idea of having a Tamogotchi or Digivice.   Overall it's not the deepest idle game but it oozes charm. A nifty little idle game that's pretty fun to keep at the bottom of my screen and I'm excited to dive into the full release! Definitely recommend checking it out.",True,0,0,6453,6373,0,4,1739056325

I had a blast having this play on stream, infact I'm having BBX farm as I write this. My only gripe is that Data Shards (material component) are so tedious to farm and most save for one automaton requires so many of them just to have *one* earlygame, not a huge fan of that otherwise.

I decided to get in touch with the developer to see if they could allow me to check this demo out slightly earlier than the publicized release of it. ----  I gotta say, this demo was a good introduction for me with Idle Games, feeling like a Life Sim management between setting up your own personalized room alongside building up money to make it better. Then from there, merging this with Battle Network mechanics such as collecting Battle Chips and using them for your automatic fights, where you can choose to let the game use them on its own, or you can strategize your own timing of unleashing them upon enemies.  This being an Idle Game, it also means I can allow this all to happen while I'm doing other things on my PC, and there's even ways to further pull this off so as to let the game run itself with even less manual input on my end of maintaining my given space. ----  I haven't done too much with this demo build, but I still suggest keeping track of this game to its full release, whether you're a fan of Idle Games and/or if you need some kind of further little Battle Network itch scratched beyond Capcom's own recent Legacy Collection of the series.

I will say that Berserk B.I.T.S shows immense promise based on the Demo alone! The kind of Battle Network style game everyone's been looking for since MMBN series released. Even to the point that Custom BITS are already an option, if a bit of a challenge to make. Perhaps that will change at full release.   You focus on managing your 'Home Server' more than battling. Some may consider that a negative, but there's still plenty to do to interact with the game. You have to feed your Programs (which is not your BITS/Net Navi), in order for them to produce chips that your BITS can use in combat. You have the option of setting the Battle Chip use to auto or manual. You also have to think about your timing on when using certain chips! (IE, you need to wait for your BITS/Navi to be in range to use a melee/slash chip, or make sure they are in the correct lane for sending a slow or medium moving attack down that lane at enemies, or timing barriers/reflects.)  The Dev has been super involved with the community, talking to people, taking feedback, noting bugs, suggestions or ideas! Absolutely eager to hear our opinions and finding ways they could improve the game as a whole.  As of right now, there are certain functions not present in the Demo that you can see in the trailer. Moving around the screens is currently locked to FullScreen mode.

Here, we are being irreverent of Ace Attorney Visual Novels, always pressing, always presenting evidence, of course there is a splash of Danganronpa in there, but mostly in the visual design, but I will say that nod to Case 3 Syndrome is well done, as [spoiler] Case 5 took me easily 50% of the time and I still think Case 3 is more bonkers. [/spoiler]  With that out of the way, Explain yourself. Explain how a Ren'Py Free-To-Play game is able to grip me for 10 hours straight as I actually lose my mind trying to grasp the game. For about the first half of it, I was in a call with 4 other people who were playing Helldivers as I listened to them frequently die to bot and bug based problems. My computer isn't powerful enough to run Helldivers, but over the course of playing that first 4 hours I lost my marbles. At one point, my brother said ""I think [General Ginger], that you would understand the game better if you weren't sober."" And eventually I had spoiled some funny moments, notably a finale in Case 2, a message to every gamer in Case 3, and a deceptively early scene in case 5. Eventually I started streaming this to everyone in the call and I think that my brother parsed it best ""I don't want to keep watching, but I can't look away"" and then another friend of ours made it even more concise when he said ""You are doomscrolling this game.""   Either way, I ended up left to my own devices for the last half of the game, which all turned out to be one case. Like I said I saw some postgame content I needed to parse (When I didn't have the threat of a horror section over my head) and would highly recommend this experience to any immortal who has been 12 years old since 2012, and any person who ever was on the internet while they either have Autism (like myself) or on shrooms. The gameplay is like a sidegraded version of Phoenix Wright, the writing is about that of the person who made Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Abridged (the one where Phoenix sends everyone to the sun and shoves ladybugs down their pants), and the memes are plentiful.  Here is a fun game for you at home: Read the Bio pages when they pop up for each character, and spot the references they make to that song as they casually speak. I can assure you, every song is important. I played ""Spot the reference"" with every piece of media available, and also played ""Attempt to accurately describe the game to a colleague while not sounding like you are having a manic episode or a drug trip or both"". All 3 of those are fun games to play.   Of course I had to get through as much of the story as I could, because when I find something cool to talk about, a seven nation army couldn't hold me back.

For a thousand years, the Republic stood as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took up arms to defend our way of life against the Separatists. In so doing, we never suspected that the greatest threat came from within.  The Jedi, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of Separatism using one of their own as the enemy's leader. They had hoped to grind the Republic into ruin. But the hatred in their hearts could not be hidden forever. At last, there came a day when our enemies showed their true natures.  The Jedi hoped to unleash their destructive power against the Republic by assassinating the head of government and usurping control of the clone army. But the aims of would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without elitist, dangerous powers. Our loyal clone troopers contained the insurrection within the Jedi Temple and quelled uprisings on a thousand worlds.  The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a new constitution!  By bringing the entire galaxy under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one individual, the corruption that plagued the Republic in its later years will never take root. Regional governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the Separatist movement to grow unchecked. A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law.  Under the Empire's New Order, our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enemies and will stand together against attacks from within or without. Let the enemies of the Empire take heed: those who challenge Imperial resolve will be crushed.  We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Empire are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the galaxy has traded war for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a secure future. The Empire will grow as more planets feel the call, from the Rim to the wilds of unknown space.  Imperial citizens must do their part. Join our grand star fleet. Become the eyes of the Empire by reporting suspected insurrectionists. Travel to the corners of the galaxy to spread the principles of the New Order to barbarians. Build monuments and technical wonders that will speak of our glory for generations to come.  The clone troopers, now proudly wearing the name of Imperial stormtroopers, have tackled the dangerous work of fighting our enemies on the front lines. Many have died in their devotion to the Empire. Imperial citizens would do well to remember their example.  The New Order of peace has triumphed over the shadowy secrecy of shameful magicians. The direction of our course is clear. I will lead the Empire to glories beyond imagining.  We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We move forward as one people: the Imperial citizens of the first Galactic Empire. We will prevail. Ten thousand years of peace begins today.",True,0,0,15,15,0,1,1739281930

There were a week or two where I did nothing but play Birdworld all day. That being said, I was not paid or commissioned to write this review, and the playtesting work I did was all voluntary and for the love of the game.  Birdworld's Demo is an artistic masterpiece. It may not be the most mechanically ground-breaking game, or the most colorful game, but it is a game that was made with great care and with great vision. I have been following the development of Birdworld since it's inception, and I have really seen how much love and effort has been put into it. The dialogue, the music, the enemy design, and even the concept is a true reflection of the developer's soul, and you can feel it during the playthrough.  Practically, it plays similar to Undertale. The characters are funny, the dialogue occasionally makes me audibly laugh, the combat can be challenging and is certainly skill based, there are so many puzzles and secrets, and areas to explore. My first save file took me about 16 hours to 100% this demo, with 4 hours spent on just the main progression (It was on itch.io before Steam). The story is engaging, but it is a game that requires your attention and requires you to read. It is a story game, and dialogue is the primary way the story progresses (though not the only way). The Birdworld demo is not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. The charm of it comes from what it is, being raw and personal, instead of sterilized and empty. The amount of content and detail of the demo is rather surprising, and might lead you to forget it's not the full game. I am looking forward to the full release of Birdworld, where the story takes us, and what happens to the lovable Adam.  tl;dr, great game made by 1 indie dev, over the course of 4 years. great characters, story, music, dialogue and good combat.",True,1,1,1466,144,0,4,1737092856

It’s your job to sneak around, devise clever strategies, and even toss your own head at foes to retrieve your belongings. Sounds absurd? That’s because it is—in the most delightful way!  Stealth, Strategy & Snailman Antics At its heart, Crashed is a stealth adventure with a quirky twist. The Snailmen guards may seem goofy, but they’re surprisingly clever, making it a fun challenge to maneuver through the facility, dodge security cameras, and discover inventive routes to your pilfered spaceship parts. While the gameplay is straightforward, it encourages exploration and thoughtful planning.  The Head-Launching Feature – Both Brilliant and Amusing B.O.B.’s removable head is what makes this game truly unique:  - Use it as a projectile to hilariously take down guards. - Snag Snailmen heads to access new areas or sneak by security. - Enjoy the chaos as enemies frantically pursue you to reclaim their lost heads. It’s a delightful blend of humor and strategy, resulting in moments of pure comedy and unexpected thrills.  Quirky Appeal & Surprising Depth Beyond the laughs, Crashed offers a surprising amount of charm. From B.O.B. nostalgically exclaiming, “I miss my wife!” to the Snailmen’s unwavering quest to protect their heads, the game is brimming with personality. It’s simple yet oddly engaging, making you cheer for B.O.B. as if he were an old buddy.  Final Thoughts ✅ B.O.B. is charming, and the world is a joy to explore. ✅ Stealth mechanics are fun, combining challenge with humor. ✅ A unique gameplay concept that’s both chaotic and clever. ❌ Some bugs and quirks, but nothing that ruins the experience. ❌ Very basic stealth mechanics—not ideal for those seeking deep complexity.

When B.O.B. leaves the safety of the crash site to reclaim his ship parts, he knows he may be caught. And yet, for a bot who can detach and reattach his own head at will, what does it truly mean to lose himself? A simple inconvenience. A calculated risk.

3405220,Dungeonfell,188494686,76561198003013967,"While the story sets the stage for the adventure, it isn't the primary focus of the game. It provides the necessary backdrop, explaining how the realm was overrun by monsters and transformed into a sprawling dungeon. However, it doesn’t delve deeply into lore or character development. The core objective is straightforward: assemble the strongest heroes and retrieve three keystones to restore order.  With the narrative taking a backseat, the gameplay and combat mechanics are what matters. Combat follows a turn-based system, with an action bar at the top displaying the turn order for both heroes and enemies. This bar also reveals upcoming enemy attacks and their potential effects, such as poison or burn. Players can gain additional insight by clicking and holding on any monster to view detailed information about its attacks.  Each hero has four unique attacks, which can be examined similarly to enemy skills. Instead of relying on mana, heroes use action points to execute their moves. Every turn, they recover half of their maximum AP, but stronger abilities require more points. If a hero lacks sufficient AP for an attack, they can draw from a shared pool called team action points. These points are replenished by weakening or defeating enemies, adding a layer of strategy.  In addition to standard attacks, players have access to spells that provide offensive, defensive, healing, or support benefits. Spells can be cast at any time but come with lengthy cooldowns. Players can equip up to four spells at a time—one from each category—but most must be unlocked before use.  A crucial mechanic prevents players from spamming basic attacks that cost a single action point. After one use, their cost increases, making it impossible to perform the same attack several times in a turn. This restriction resets at the start of each new round.  The game provides ample information to facilitate tactical decision-making. Enemies indicate their intended target with an arrow, which also displays expected damage and hit probability. Basic attacks can miss, but special attacks always land—albeit with cooldowns to balance their reliability.   Another notable feature is the enemy health bar, which includes segmented boxes beneath it. Each successful attack removes a box, and if all are depleted, the enemy loses its turn. These boxes regenerate at the start of the enemy’s next turn, allowing players to time their attacks strategically to interrupt powerful hits.  Progression is structured across three chapters, each composed of multiple acts, culminating in boss fights. Each act serves as an independent run featuring several waves of enemies, followed by a boss encounter. The game allows players to pause and resume their run, but completion is required to unlock the next stage.  Staying true to the roguelite genre, players choose their next battle from a map, selecting encounters based on difficulty and potential rewards, such as health, money, or artifacts. Completing a fight grants the opportunity to upgrade one skill per hero, but choices are random. Occasionally, players will also obtain relics that persist through the run, offering bonuses like increased AP recovery or enhanced attack power.  At the end of a run, players receive money and special artifacts. Each chapter features a unique artifact that acts as a progression gate, preventing players from becoming overpowered too quickly. These resources are used to enhance existing heroes and recruit new ones.  Despite being limited to a three-hero team per run, the game offers a roster of 15 distinct heroes. Each is categorized by role—such as healer or tank—and rated across three key attributes: attack, defense, and utility. While base stats remain fixed, heroes can improve their abilities through a streamlined yet effective skill tree system.   Upgrades may enhance attacks, such as adding a poison effect or striking twice, but choices are limited by each hero’s predefined skill tree. Additionally, skill trees may unlock new spells for the spellbook or relics that become available in future runs.  Overall, the game delivers a deep and engaging turn-based combat experience, rewarding careful planning and strategic execution. Its blend of roguelite progression, tactical battles, and meaningful upgrades ensures that each run feels fresh and rewarding, even as players strive to conquer the ever-challenging dungeon.",True,7,0,122,122,0,1798,1740231197

3405220,Dungeonfell,188440186,76561198031599084,"[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/38888018-United-Critics/] Please follow [b]United Critics[/b] for quality reviews[/url]  [h2]Dungeonfell Review[/h2]  [h1]Honkai Star Rail Who?[/h1] So, Dungeonfell is a tactical team-based roguelite where you lead a group of Delvers through ever-changing dungeons, battling monsters and uncovering the corruption lurking in the depths. Sounds intense, right? It definitely is. You’ve got different Delvers, unique abilities, and a whole bunch of strategic choices to make. And let’s be real—this game will test your patience and planning skills.  [h1]About This Game [/h1]  [h2]Storyline [/h2] The game doesn’t shove an overly complex narrative in your face, but there’s enough mystery and intrigue to keep you hooked. You’re diving into dungeons filled with corruption, fighting off monstrous creatures, and trying to cleanse whatever evil is festering in the shadows. It’s the classic ""dark force lurking in the depths"" kind of story, but it works well with the roguelite structure. The real charm is in discovering bits and pieces of lore as you progress.  [h2]Gameplay Mechanics [/h2] Here’s where things get interesting. Dungeonfell is turn-based, which I normally wouldn’t be super into, but it’s actually really fun. You assemble a team of Delvers, each with their own skills, and fight through different dungeon biomes. There’s a good amount of strategy involved—choosing your team composition, deciding which paths to take, and making the most of your abilities.  [h1]Pros[/h1] [list][*] Fun, tactical gameplay that even non-turn-based fans can enjoy. [*] Loads of strategic depth with different Delvers and skill synergies. [*] The Cosmic Delver Map gives a real sense of progression. [*] Decent story that doesn’t overshadow the gameplay. [*] Solid art direction and atmospheric audio.[/list]  [h1]Cons[/h1] [list][*] The UI, while good-looking, can be a little sluggish. [*] Bugs here and there, like abilities targeting the wrong characters. [*] If you miss the tutorial (like I did), your first run might be painful. [*] Some turn-based mechanics might feel slow for players who prefer fast-paced action.[/list]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] Overall, Dungeonfell is a solid roguelite with a ton of replayability and depth. The team-based mechanics, different routes, and ability synergies make for a fresh experience every run. It’s got a few rough edges—some bugs and a UI that could use a little more polish—but nothing game-breaking. If you enjoy tactical RPGs, or even if you don’t but are willing to try something new, this one is worth checking out.  Rating: 8/10 Imagine if they added Gacha Elements, like gambling for characters.

Is it worth it? Nope. Absolutely not!  As mercenary, Lilith definitely numbers among the loveliest and most badass characters in game, and her outfits are all top-notch as befits a lewd Yakuza minx. However, this just makes the disappointment about her mascot all the greater as the model and its animations are of a rather poor quality. The design just doesn't wow like her Halloween [i]Slutty Pumpkin[/i] version or Lola's [i]White Rabbit[/i] model did.   The most obvious flaws are the mascot's animations, which are not smooth but come off as rather jumpy. There is obviously not enough geometry in her body model to support smooth and soft transitions in high curvature regions which appear somewhat angular and edged. This is most evidently the case with her boobs due to unrefined loops and residing edges resulting in noticeable deformations on the mesh when at rest or during animations. Another negative point is her somewhat weird facial expression that makes her look sad, or just generally upset, giving her the appearance of a clumsy little anime girl.  On top of that, the excessive price tag of more than 50 USD is just off the charts insane! I grabbed her for around 34 bucks during this year's winter sale, but the few extra resources you get in addition to this poorly modeled mascot still offer little value for all the money.

You can see the parts where the developer wanted to convey a story, but the transition between the two game modes isn’t smooth, making it feel like two separate games running independently. This makes it hard for anyone who doesn’t like both genres equally to see it as a positive aspect.  If the starting point and destination in the racing mode were connected to the camp in the Vampire mode, it might have been more immersive.  Still, considering its price, it’s an impressive indie game that delivers decent value for money.

3404700,Red Rocket Defencism Demo,188876063,76561198135854754,"Elyusha my beloved....  It's a tower defense with a very small aspect of an rts. The demo is very short but fun and it gets its points across. If you like tower defenses, it's an easy recommend. If you want details, read ahead.  Your defenses are only obtained at the end of the wave where you're given three cards to buy with the money earned enemies. you can reroll your choices with money as well. The demo has enough variety to make the td part fun. you can upgrade your defenses by placing the same building on top of it. only once though. Other than the tower defense aspect of it, you also control a hero unit helping out your towers. you can attach other units to your hero to increase your damage, damage resistance, and/or movement speed. You don't control them individually like an rts, they follow your hero around so not much micro-ing. If you've played dawn of war, it's like the imperial guard commander and attaching other support units to em. honestly, very appropriate.   In terms of graphics, it shows what it has instead of having extremely detailed art for characters like certain minimalist games where there's a huge detachment between what you see in the cover art/art outside of gameplay. Gameplay has minimalist graphics all through out the while NPCS are just slightly more detailed and are very cute.   The only problem I have, and it's more personal, is that everything is too saturated for my eyes. I know soviets are all about reds and yellows for their color palettes but the choices of hues here are eye burning. Having and option for different color palettes could be nice but again, that's more personal. I'm not here to crap on the art team's vision for the style.  Music is also really nice, changing throughout every wave. It's what you'd expect for a soviet theme but more EDM. It's something i'd like to add to my playlist. The dubstep part in the later days is a strange choice but it's not too blaring, just kinda out of place.",True,2,0,38,38,0,12,1740674521

It feels like Thronefall if it were made for the Game Boy Color, but with modern design sensibilities and a Sovietic kawaii theme. The soundtrack is perfectly on point, like it was composed by a Russian Skrillex. The dialogue is engaging, with excellent timing and gamefeel.  I don’t have much to criticize, but if I had to point out one thing, it’s that a single stage felt a bit long. Toward the end, I wasn’t making many meaningful decisions beyond stacking towers and buying everything I could.

Characters all stand out and have lots of personality and the dialogue is cute, funny, and engaging. I personally really like how towers and enemies all share the same area. I hope in the full game you can do more with your character like getting them upgrades or new abilities but I could also see how the towers themselves could provide that progressively.

Some mechanics like meditating currently have no practical use, and could be used for HP healing, specially useful in the crash course/ ninja agility dungeons where you have to dodge and your HP gets drained fast, the Zelda-like mini dungeons, like the one with the giant wind blowers were my favourite ones, the game specially shines there.

The game is very charming, the voxel art is visually interesting and there's a lot of potential for a great combat system.  The experience this time around was good enough to keep me interested, be able to playtest it for a while and change the review to recommended.  That being said, devs, i want to point out some stuff that needs to be polished further:  1)there's still stuttering in the game, far less than the previous version, but when changing screens, interacting with the save point for the first time in an area, interacting with a lever in the cave, talking to your friend shinobi NPC, etc. It's just a fraction of a second, but it's enough to be distracting.  2)in the first map, if you try to interact with the campfire from a direction that isn't left or right, the character will turn aroudn and run in place. It's not a game breaking bug but it's something you guys could fix.  3)inside the game, there's a section of bridge with 2 gaps you have to dash through. If you miss the second dash and land on the wall between the top and bottom floors, you get stuck. You can't walk there at all, but you can dash away, but it's an awkward angle to dash back to the ground which may cause unintended deaths to new players.  4)the big daruma/tomato enemies that shoot fireballs need some rework. The projectile is too fast, tracks to your position too well, there's not enough of an animation before it's launched to make you able to learn the pattern and dodge it, and after it's launched it's too fast to be able to comfortably dodge. For an early enemy, specially a demo enemy, it's not a fun experience. Also, if you stick close to the enemy it never attacks at all, you can just follow it around.  5)overall, the enemies take too many hits to kill. Your weapon is fast and the enemies are easy to fight, but it's not very fun to have to spam your attack button to kill little baby enemies.  Please take these as suggestions of improvements, and not complaints.  I'll be back to try it again in the next version if there is one! Good luck on development!  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- PREVIOUS VERSION REVIEW:I'm very interested in the game, but i'll be waiting for the next version of the demo. The current version is a bit too buggy to even test it out.  On the intro cutscene, after the story bit ends and it shows the characters sitting around a campfire, it loaded halfway and got stuck there. After reloading and redoing the whole intro it loaded properly.   Once i got control of my character, everything stuttered so bad that i felt i every single shader was loading for the first time whenever i took an action. If that's how the engine works, please rework it to pre-load shaders when installing/first booting the game instead. If that's not it, something else is wrong with the engine that might be worth looking into.  After a little while i got into a cave, and in the ""dashing"" tutorial, i fell into a hole... except i didn't fell, i got stuck into the black void, stading there completely unable to move.  You get the idea, i don't think the game itself is bad, but i couldn't play enough of it to know if it was good either!  This will be a negative review because i was unable to actually experience the demo, but if changes are made i'll play it again and re-review it.",True,0,0,43,43,0,46,1737035909

3404140,Bloody Night Cult,190837488,76561197995669628,"I don't think it's a bad game but it does have a number of oversight issues, toward the end there are a few very frustrating sections, sometimes it's technical problems like quest triggers, and sometimes it's just bad design choices that make the game harder than it needed to be. All the cheap deaths left a very bitter taste in my mouth because I felt it was more trial and error and not challenge, literally exhausted from all the repetition that I experienced, even though I can see that generally it's not a bad experience, at least from the narrative point, actually had some genuinely intense horror moments, assuming you don't mind getting spooked a bit.   You get to explore a small town that kinda has that Silent Hill aesthetic to it, the same kind of limited visibility and a misty tone, also with a few thematic similarities like the cult and some fleshy looking creatures running around, although to be fair I am not getting the same narrative vibes. You should be able to beat the game in about 2 to 3 hours, at least if you not running into any weird trigger glitches. There is some limited exploration, as well as some dialogue choices that presumably change parts of the story, so you could replay it a few times, if you really wanted to. For the most part the game is telling you exactly what to do, there are a few puzzles but they are not very intuitive and can be a little confusing with triggers.  Even though I generally like the retro filters, visibility was a problem in some parts of the game. You can try a few different VHS filters in the settings, I used the ""glitched"" one because it gave me more visibility, but I also didn't like the line effect that came with it. That being said, I think you guys need to find a better balance, it's okay to use retro texture and filter, but not at the cost of actually hurting the gameplay experience.  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  (+) Things like death animations, tension building, and jump scares were generally good, I am not always a fan of intense horror games but they were mostly in good taste, and not in a very cheesy kind of way, I almost choked on my salad a few times. Although honestly some of the quest trigger made me lose the immersion a little.   (+) It has some dialogue/narrative choices, decent number of optional achievements as well. The story was alright, probably could use a few more optional responses for the characters, but overall, it had some mystery to it, it had a few weird locations and scenes, it's not bad.  [h1] Feedback: [/h1]  - you can get killed while doing events like disarming or doing the mimic puzzle, also in that puzzle the males are too hard to tell apart. The trap event feels too fast, it's almost like 50-50 if I hit them right now  - I think you should make the filters and shading less intense, at least make the menu buttons more visible, for example the arrows for item movement. Also for the filters, I thought the ""glitch"" was the best one for visibility, but the white lines kinda ruined it for me. So maybe a happy medium, something between glitch and default, give player the option to have a cleaner aesthetic for the game, you don't have to remove the mist and texture, just make it a little easier to see things  - this game has like the worst running speed in any game I ever played, I get that you need it for the cult members to keep up with you, but honestly, the game might feel better if you just made it a little faster, just so you can travel around the town better  [b] Update: [/b] They fixed the slow movement, and made the visibility a lot better.  - I was confused with the part where you have to run away from officers, I talked to someone instead and got another quest trigger, not sure if it was meant to work that way, but it seems confusing because it kept telling me to talk to them, and then I got the gas/car trigger instead. Also, was the cult member model meant to be stuck at the gas station door?  - sometimes dialogue of the characters fails to update if you already completed certain triggers, say if you already got 5 totems, or already have the cereal box  - overall I think you could give the side characters a few more lines, they feel a bit too placeholder right now, maybe some rumors, would make sense for the cult themed game  [b] Overall Thoughts: 6/10 [/b]  I actually think it's a neat experience and it feels like it has more effort than most indie horror games, but they kinda dropped the ball with the polish. Don't make the player angry over and over, make sure the game flows well with the difficulty, make sure it's not overly frustrating or confusing, like the immersion of the game can do all the heavy lifting, don't ruin it with cheap deaths and **** like getting killed while disarming. Improve the visibility a bit, make the quest dialogue and hints cleaner, and I think the game will be more enjoyable. Like the game has a decent story, there is no need for that last section to be as trial and error as it is.

So is this dlc, do not buy this shit for 5 dollars lol This is a folder full of video files. There's no concept art, no test maps, nothing to actually look at besides videos.   The video files show test footage and promo materials from previous iterations of Project Three. None of what you can see is groundbreaking but it was interesting to see the development change from a somewhat promising game to utter slop.  The Outside isn't worth talking about other than it mostly being boring test maps, premature OST releases, and a ""gameplay"" trailer.  Project Three 2021-22 shows way more promise of fun and polish than Project Three does now. That version had more weapons, source-ish items physics, the gravity gun, and even a seemingly functional deathmatch mode. It had a very charming pixel artstyle that kinda gave it an identity of sorts. Seeing pixel-textured Gordon Freeman reload weapons in third person was endearing. I don't know why the developer didn't just stick with this version it could have been kinda cool.  Project Three 2023 comes off as the developer seeing a Puppet Combo game and saying ""that looks cool ill do that now"" because the previous pixel artstyle is side-graded to samey psx vibes. This is arguably the most boring of the footage as its just weapon tests.  ",False,2,0,0,,0,35,1742777112

If you have even the [i]slightest[/i] interest in horror and have played [i]even just[/i] [b]one[/b] of those little indie horror games you find everywhere on Steam, then you know [b]EXACTLY[/b] what's going to happen, [b]beat by beat[/b]. That's not to say there isn't anything good in the game, nor am I saying that there aren't other issues worth talking about. [i]Look....[/i] all I'm trying to say is [i]that I've played these games before[/i]. you hear me?      The game begins [b]as any proper horror game should start[/b], by introducing us to a single, 20s something dude who [i]hates his job[/i], is buried [i]in student loans[/i], and [i]can only afford the cheapest and crappiest on the housing market[/i]. how else would you relate to your target audience? [b]he's literally me![/b] (*ahem*) so our hero man (I'm just going to call him Larry), just got home from work, and is doing his usual nightly routine. Eating dinner, washing dishes, brushing teeth, [i]all that exciting stuff[/i]; when all of a sudden, [i]he hears a strange noise in the living room[/i]. [b]w h a t   c o u l d   i t   b e ? ?[/b] Upon entering, he finds one of the framed photos on the ground, and on the wall in its place are the words [b]“In the darkness, you will find us”[/b]. huh.... whelp, it's awfully late, and I ought to be getting to bed now. [b]G'night[/b].      The first thing you'll notice about [b]The New Apartment[/b] is that [i]there really isn't any actual gameplay[/i]. You're going around your house, just... [b]living[/b]. Wash the dishes. [b]check[/b]. Brush your teeth. [b]check[/b]. Now [i]turn on your little night light and grab your teddy and say nighty night[/i]. [b]check-a-doodle[/b]. That's about as involved as the game gets, and we haven't even gotten to the horror yet. Once the lights go out and the spooky stuff starts, you're tasked with mindlessly moving around the apartment, searching for whatever weird occurrence just happened. There [i]is[/i] a puzzle in the last fourth of the game or so, but other than that, it's a [b]straight up walking simulator, with nowhere to even walk[/b]. And [i]don't get me wrong[/i], moving around in the dark [i]can[/i] be pretty unnerving, but as the game drags on, [spoiler]combined with the fact that you're in absolutely no danger for 99% of the runtime[/spoiler], the only feeling you'll have is [b]boredom[/b].      The production values of [b]The New Apartment[/b] are an equally mixed bag. Visually, the game actually looks really sharp, with hyper-realistic props and textures. I wouldn't be at all surprised if over half the assets came pre-made from Unreal Engine, but [i]hey[/i], it still looks great, and there are enough little details to prove that the developer really cared [spoiler](some of the book titles on the shelf are hilarious. our man Larry has both Politics for Winners AND Politics for Losers. ...I'm sure that joke offended someone somewhere)[/spoiler]. And the sound design is [b]fantastic[/b]; being both distinct and unsettling, without just going down the typical [b]L0Ud NOiSES!! ! ![/b] route. Unfortunately, the game runs like [b]crap[/b], with the FPS frequently dipping down [i]into the 10s[/i], with the motion blur (which you can't turn off) [b]making me want to puke[/b]. (I don't know my exact computer assessments, but I could run Apex Legends just fine at 60). It's also kind of difficult figuring out what items you can and can't interact with, because the icon is [b]so darn small[/b] and the camera makes me feel like I'm drunk anyway. And Larry's comments throughout the whole game just scream “[b]I'm a modern horror movie protagonist with no personality[/b]”. like, [i]can we[/i] PLEASE stop the trope where [i]horror movie characters do stupid things because they're like[/i] “[b]heh heh, I'm not in a horror movie or anything! I have so much to live for!![/b]”? It's not [b]funny[/b], it's not [b]clever[/b], and it feels like [i]you're making an excuse for[/i] [b]bad writing[/b]. And it's not like the rest of Larry's comments are any better: [b]“well, that just happened!”, “I take a dump here every day”[/b], [spoiler]“macaroni. good.”.[/spoiler]      And now, for the main thing that turned me off about [b]The New Apartment[/b], the [i]very thing that made me decide on the negative rating[/i], [b]we have the ending[/b]..............spoilers, [i]obviously[/i]. After you solve the riddle and open the combination lock, you open up the jewelry box and find a note that simply states “[b]It is time. You are worthy. She is coming[/b]”. Almost [i]immediately[/i], your front door swings open, and the wind becomes unnaturally [b]loud[/b]. The game prompts you to hide in the bathroom, [i]which you do[/i]. [b]you sit in the dark... holding your breath... waiting for it all to end.... you hear footsteps... and heavy breathing.... that... that can't be human.[/b] oh[i]oh[/i]oh-[b]oh my gosh it's opening the door....[/b] it's... [i]it's...[/i] IT'S.. [spoiler]it's a seven foot dark glowing demon thing with no face.[/spoiler] [b]spooky[/b]. and [i]you know what happens next?[/i] [spoiler]...it kills you. ….like, yeah. The demon guy (or lady, I suppose) kills you, and you're thrown right back to the title screen[/spoiler].….GGs!! and MAN, what a crazy conclusion!! A horror game ending with [spoiler]a tall dark figure brutally murdering you before abruptly going back to the title?[/spoiler] [b]that is just SHOCKING!![/b] why, [i]I haven't seen a horror game end like that since[/i] [b]The Last Job[/b], or [b]Missing Hiker[/b], or [b]Nightmare of Decay[/b], or [b]The Grave Keeper[/b], or [b]Big Larry[/b], or---y'know what [i]I'm just gonna stop right there[/i]. And as always, my reaction remains exactly the same: [spoiler]“...........aight. …..I'm gonna go play Balatro now”.[/spoiler]      If you want an easy and short horror experience for cheap, you could be doing a whole lot worse than [b]The New Apartment[/b]. While there's not much to it, and it doesn't run very well, the visuals look just fine; and the atmosphere is genuinely [i]really good[/i].

For less than $1 ""The New Apartment"" feels more like a demo, a proof of concept, or just a idea what this dev is capable of, which is not a bad thing!  In terms of story there really isn't much. The horror factor of ""The New Apartment"" relies solely on a slow burn of solid graphics, great lighting, and tense audio. If the dev perhaps had a bigger budget and more time this game could be a standout hit, but for now I'll settle a promising new indie horror dev on my radar.  Dear dev,  Please take my humble dollar and continue the great work. I got my eyes on you and I hope your next project only expands upon the potential I see in you.

It, naturally, means that you need to lower your expectation in the sense that the product in question will probably not be the most polished one. This, however, shouldn't be a deterring factor. Quite the contrary! I'm always happy to give feedback!  In [i]The New Apartment[/i] you play as the new tenant of a rented place. As a walking sim you can walk around and interact with a lot of objects and this is also how you make the story progress. One thing I noted - and I liked a lot - is the amount of witty remarks your protagonist has when interacting with certain items or just entering another area in the apartment. I suggest you carefully look at everything before proceeding with the story.  And how do you proceed? Just pay attention to what our hero says to know where your next objective might be. Saying anything more would be a spoiler. You are done in 20-30 minutes (depending on how fast you solve the puzzle). Since this is a horror game, I recommend playing it in the evening with your headset on.  Whilst I appreciate that Unreal Engine 5 is used here, it takes a lot of power from your PC. There is only one slider for graphics and as it has 3 stages I have to assume they correspond to an overall level of low, medium and high. In the last one I already had a low FPS value of 24-30 while playing and, unfortunately, v-sync didn't work, at all. Medium was fine and I didn't notice any changes. A little polish (as in optimisation) is all this game needs. I hope Paul reads this and releases a couple of updates: I'm happy to do the testing!",True,29,0,23,23,0,1068,1738527619

They presumably have the game files, including all the music tracks, do they not...?  Honestly, and I hate to say it considering how much I enjoyed the game, but the devs have clearly been lazy with this OST. Aside from not including tracks that you could find in your own game's files, they didn't bother with editing them in any way to fit a soundtrack that a person would actually listen to. They couldn't bother looping ""Lift Music"" a few times so that it's not a 14-second track. All the ambient tracks that loop in the game are left as-is, which means they all end super abruptly.

[b]- Inventory:[/b] using madness to block/hide inventory items is a great idea. However, the use of weapons and tools that have to be manually re-assigned to the taskbar each time, and the fact that the tool in hand is not visible in the inventory but in the character sheet... useless and headache-inducing.   [b]- Insanity system:[/b] Very nice, it adds interest to staying longer outside the train to accumulate insanity, and forces you to play a little more dangerously. However, at first it's not very intuitive how to add a “madness” spell.  [b]- This leads to the 3rd point: the user interface [/b] needs to be reviewed. There's a lot of useful info, but it's far from eye-catching. The dodge is at the bottom right, and all you get is a number when you want to cast it again. Ditto for life. Maybe my screen is too big for an interface like this, but I have to admit that I find it hard to go to the top left every time to see my life, hunger and sanity, or to the bottom right to see if I still have a dodge or something.  [b]- Multiplayer:[/b] Excellent, we can play together. But please. Make it possible to change the train driver. And above all, let one player explore the map while another takes care of the crafts on the train. You can't share roles, you have to do everything together. This breaks the pace of the game, which is already pretty slow.  [b]- The combat system:[/b] exploration is okay, but could be more dynamic. Fighting is rather “simplistic”, and the fact that you can mostly turn around your opponent to hit him and dodge his attacks makes combat unattractive at first. What's more, blows and spells lack impact, even when you receive one. A little more dynamism wouldn't go amiss.  [b]- the crafting system from the train:[/b] I've got chests here and there, let me craft at a workshop without having to go back and forth with each chest...  [b]- The tutorial:[/b] It's slow. But really slow. I can't imagine that it would attract a lot of people if I started the game and thought that it was so slow to do all the starting, harvesting, crafter so much before leaving etc..   I think the game has room for improvement in terms of feedback and overall gameplay feel. But maybe it's not just planned to be a game with fast paced, but more a slow exploration, with people exploring together and with several phases strongly splitted (exploration - evolve the train - naviguate - explore - ...)  I can only recommand you to [b]try this demo[/b] to build your own opinion on this game, but right now, I [b]wouldn't recommend to buy the full game yet[/b].

The art style is consistent and has a very old-gods kind of vibe that I can appreciate.   Before I talk about the real issues, I have a gripe: why TF is there a hunger mechanic in this game? Like for real, is it just here because the devs think that it has to be because the the  game has a gathering mechanic? Having to watch a food meter to click on celery ... thrilling. Maybe consider swapping that out for a system where you get buffs from eating? Carrot not (annoyance)stick.  Okay FR now: the combat is no good. A lot of your attacks root you in place, meanwhile a lot of enemies lack any kind of windup to their attacks and move faster than you do, meaning if you stop to attack, you are pretty much taking damage immediately. The vomiting enemies are an especially good example of the lack of windup (or telegraphing) on attacks. The first frame of the attack animation damages you, meaning you have to preempt it, which is just objectively poor design. The bug swarms are faster than you and will 100% hit you at least once most of the time, there's more examples but I think I've made my point, enemies made badly, please make goodly. The first area's monsters deal way too much damage to you while you're learning your timings etc. Between the lack of good balance, and the guaranteed damage, it limits exploration to the number of healing items you happen to have in your inventory. My first death was a choice to avoid having to walk all the way back across the map to get more healing items and to walk all the way across the map again.

It all more or less functions, but none of it is what I'd call good. I'd suggest the devs look to similar games and seriously ponder what makes them fun to play.  Food, for instance, should be more than a chore to be completed. Give me some buffs for making fancy recipes or something. Or a trade off between going hungry or filling up on...questionable meals (a full belly but a troubled mind?). *Update! Turns out some foods do give buffs, you just have to find them. Capital!* Construction times have a similar problem. Just replace them with a fun little animation of the train's tentacles whipping up a nice, disturbing, home-cooked meal. The animations are already there, just spice them up a bit and drop the unnecessary wait time. Or, again, put in a trade-off. Like, a mini-game for making things. Maybe you can do it more efficiently by hand, or just let the train handle it 'cause you've got cultists to hunt.

I can only assume Cargo Cult thinking of ""Other successful games have them, so we need to have them too!""  It adds nothing to the game or actively subtracts from it. The food in the game was so abundant that eating is only a chore and takes up valuable inventory space, while adding nothing to the feel of the game. Make the food a source of buffs so players will want to engage with it and remove the hunger bar or just remove it from the game altogether.  Crafting times: Just why? As a developer you want the players to engage with your world and not for them to stand there for 2 minutes because we need 60 boards for the next set of walls. And before you say its to fill time while traveling, the time can comfortably filled with actually crafting and building, not standing in front of a crafting bench waiting for a timer, as there is no reason to travel below maximumg speed thanks to the auto stop feature.  The thing I want to praise is the madness mechanic adding a risk/reward mechanic making deeper expeditions riskier, but with home teleport being one of the first spells you get and being able to reset it in the train without having to leave its also rather pointless in the end. Though making it your level up mechanic is nice.  Other than that the game feels rather... bland. For an Eldritch Horror game the world doesn't have enough fog, gloomy lighting, tentacles and teeth. Most of the time it just feels like any generic survival crafting game where your base is recolored as a train with the fuel just renamed and recoloured.

I can tell from the demo there is a lot of work to be added in early access after all this is a demo.

UPD for the devs:  Font size is tiny and the text is often colored similarly to its background, making reading tedious. As a person with not the best eyesight I find it very annoying.  There's drag-and-drop mechanic, but no way to sort items. The only way to craft an item from the inventory is to hover a mouse over the blueprint it and hold MMB. What about double-clicking? What about adding a visual ""Craft"" button?  The blueprint section also lacks any kind of sorting system – blueprints for weapon, armor, healing items and tools all mixed together and there's no way to even sort them manually.  I have quick slots, but the only way to assign an item to it is by hovering over it and pressing the number key. Why can't I use drag-and-drop since you have it in the game?  Can't pick up items while doing something (can't pick up wood while swinging axe) despite the tip hovering on the screen. Maybe it's by design, but then why am I able to use items from the quick bar while swinging the axe?  Completed quest are cluttering the screen.

3403600,RailGods of Hysterra Demo,188267831,76561198171981970,"TLDR: this game needs more time, even if the content is in a ""releasable state"". it feels as if the devs have not play tested this with the idea of an enjoyable experience in mind. the sorry state this demo is in is only redeemed with the fact i can play with friends. devs, please take note of what i mention below.  Currently, the demo is overwhelmingly lacking in the quality of life department for just simple and basic things. alot of these problems could be solved with the devs asking ""is this part of the feature improving the experience?"" and then taking the time to preen off these often boring or annoying peices of most of the game's core mechanics. the timers for crafting and building are particularly bad as there's simply no need to suffer through 7 minutes of waiting around, just to feel like i have enough resources for the next hour of my gameplay.  another issue i have is the boring and janky combat's odd delays and unreasonable bloating. the combat has all sorts of bloat stuffed in that makes it feel extremely annoying, if i attack, i expect to get the feedback for it. instead there's a flat delay, and the enemies couldn't care less. speaking of the enemies, despite the enemy variety on display, they felt extremely lackluster, and were all around just more time wasting than anything. their health pools mean that even the basic enemies take a significant amount of time to dispatch, even with 3 people attacking, and their attacks can be spontaneous, without any indication except for some sort of background timer. coupled with the often inconsistent hits of whether any attack (including player and enemy attacks) would actually hit their mark, only aoe attacks were able to create a consistent flow to the combat. this means that i quickly switched to two things: the basic tools that have an aoe melee attack, and the middle ranged spell that causes some sort of earthquake. This served me well enough that my friends and I could get through the game. That is if we weren't dying to unbalanced enemies like the inescapable swarm. another bug i found with the combat is that strafing while attacking seems to guarantee a miss, but that is not something i'd consider a design flaw that requires tweaking like the other things i've mentioned.  my next issue is the multiplayer, despite it being one of the more redeeming things about this game. something indicated by one of the people i played with is that a multiplayer run levels up much faster than a singleplayer run. that means after 4 ares, we had already reached the max level for the dlc. we hadn't even seen a new enemy at that point. this is in part due to waiting to see what 100% madness would do (not a whole lot sadly), but even then, it would have been barely half a level extra more to reach the max level. the worst part though, is that despite gaining the new abilities quickly, the game still felt incredibly slow, in fact, i'm not even sure why basic mechanics like being able to see the map before exploring it aren't just a passive unlock as part of the story. on top of this, the multiplayer felt very much like a singleplayer experience, something similar to how dark souls co-op is handled. there were a few things that seemed like an odd restriction. for example, only the host being able to enter the front traincar, or when one person enters a new area, everyone is forced into it no matter what (this means anything on the ground is deleted as i fortunately found out very early on with one of my deaths. (I lost an axe and that was it, thankfully no actual gear, since that would have been a very displeasing waste of time otherwise.)  I also have issues with the ""tutorial"" sort of thing when starting the game. it was frustrating that i had to go through 5 minutes of just scripted gameplay, get to the train and then have to click on the buttons the game wants me to click  before being able to explore the game's train mechanics. all of it could have been supplemented with a goal to collect X amount of wood, etc. get on the train, and the use the menu to craft a thing. for a game that naturally doesn't have much direction beyond ""you need to do X"" without much visable reason for why, this completely threw me off when starting out. if i wasn't playing with my friend that had already played a bit, i would have been fairly confused on how the game is meant to be played.  another thing (yeah, there's more), is that the UI and controls for kbm feel horrible. Combat has no auto targeting for starters, this means that lower skill players will be completely unable to use ranged weapons. this is of course assuming that the combat will be improved at all, because low skill players can't play in the state it's in without healing after every enemy anyway. the main problem though is that the inventory is unintuitive, the menus have no hotkeys, the inventories don't even have a sort button ffs, the first tier items in the menus are all the same colour too, so it is a pain in the ass to have to slowly look through my unsorted inventory just to find that the resource i'm looking for was in the chest i checked twice. this was a common issue. not only that but you can't craft directly from chests either, hell you can't even access anything, including doors, at the same time as another person. it's bizzare to me that these things weren't implemented when the system was created, as if there wasn't a design plan for this mechanic.  To be honest, this demo alone could have an hour long video showing what was done wrong with a quick suggestion of how to improve it, but, i want to point out some of the things this game does well too. It has a good world. It has a great concept. It nails the theme it's going for. it has good effects (where they're actually implemented, looking at you enemy ghoul who's slam does nothing but create a few red circles). it has a good progression path (the pace of this progression seems a bit odd at times unfortunately). and it has the bones for something that could be up there and potentially above games V Rising or Remnant 1/2 or Once Human. What does it need to get there though? the content, the quality of life changes, and for the love of the elder gods add a damn keybind menu with some actual hotkeys.",False,1,0,182,182,0,29,1739971104

It feels like it has a solid foundation thus far, and I'd definitely be down to play some more. I did think of a few things that could potentially improve the game however. An auto sort / stack feature for your inventory / chests would be a huge benefit. Also when you're crafting several things at a work station, it would be really useful if there was a cancel button. It would also be nice if you could use materials that are in storage in a workbench, but that's just me being lazy I suppose, but I did find hearing the door to the train cars opening and closing several times while going back and forth for materials a bit annoying.

This game has potential, but they half assed it, as in some of the ladies voices don't even match the characters. The main character's voice is clearly spoken into the mic. He did his job, he had feeling. And for the ladies part, they showed NO FEELING in the character, like they are reading from a script, all monotone. What was hella weird is when this one chick in the game went from a woman's voice and then changed to a mans voice for a couple of sentences, like w t f !?!? One woman had a stuffy nose talking, like really?? Put some fricking feeling into the character, sell that sh*t !! But wait, they failed to do that. And plus their audio when speaking into the mic sometimes goes in and out or the audio doubles for a quick second, as in their voice has a high tone and then a different tone later in the same conversation that you have with your character. And for one thing why the frick did you make the guys prick a purple grey color???????? just make it the same fricking color as the skin of the person. it's so simple *asian voice*...lol. and for the butthole on the woman, why the frick is her butthole so close to her kitty?? The penetration of the limo to the backdoor doesn't match up..haha. And also one of the things i forgot to mention was in the beginning of the game, when you choose your name, it shows in the background that you can customize your character, but the dumb part is, you can't customize your character. Why put it there when you can't alter your character. And also another thing, the sex noises REALLY DO NOT MATCH THE SEX SCENE!! UNTIL THEY FIX THOSE, THE GAME IS NOT WORTH IT FOR THAT PRICE, IT SHOULD BE AROUND 5 BUCKS AT MOST!! If everything was polished to the teeth!!

Some great use of lighting, and a VHS tape view that feels actually authentic instead of the nonsense we usually get.  Bravo.  The setting is also very cool.  The negative is really just that KLAWS, our decidedly robust villain, has the endurance of a marathon runner.  It's fine, I suppose.  Maybe he works out, specifically legs.  But that's not really the point.  Without an ability to really stop the guy from catching you, I can only assume he eats your face.  You have stamina that regenerates pretty quickly, and it's quite adequate in most situations.  But occasionally you just can't get away.  And then you have to do it all over again.

However, here I think it merits an exception:  Ever Hotter takes on a guise of a run-of-the-mill visual novel, to tell a story of human relationships. Here, the protagonist's past becomes entwined with the circumstances of the rest of the characters. Yes, in the foreground you have all the sexual power fantasies that a visual novel always promises: a harem of girls with whom you can develop a choice, the opportunity to live diverse sexual experiences, spicy scenes... but in the background, there is an underlying message about the past that haunts us and the consequences of our choices. And also, you can tell by the sheer number of characters for the standard of this kind of product.  Undoubtedly, it's just another food work for a company dedicated to making entertaining games dedicated to a niche audience, but you can tell that the writer doesn't take it that way. There is talent behind who wrote this.  Personally, I'm going to follow very closely everything he does in the future...  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  VERSIÓN EN ESPAÑOL:  Normalmente, no suelo reseñar este tipo de juegos.

Sin embargo, aquí creo que amerita una excepción:  Más y más caliente toma un disfraz de una novela visual al uso, para contar una historia de relaciones humanas. Aquí, el pasado del protagonista, se termina enlazando con la circunstancia del resto de personajes. Sí, en primer plano tienes todas las fantasías de poder sexual que una novela visual te promete siempre: un harem de chicas con las que puedes ir desarrollando una elección, la oportunidad de vivir diversas experiencias sexuales, escenas picantes... pero de trasfondo, hay un mensaje subyacente sobre el pasado que nos persigue y las consecuencias de nuestras elecciones. Y también, se nota por el gran número de personajes que hay para el estándar de este tipo de producto.  Sin duda, es un trabajo alimenticio más para una empresa dedicada a hacer juegos entretenidos dedicados a un público de nicho, pero se nota que el escritor no se lo toma así.

Did not notice any bugs which is very promising. I only found one issue and that was ships don't appear to have an angular velocity cap, so they can be spun around at aliasing speeds (which doesn't really affect anything).

I love that this looks like a simple LUA game. I really dig the simple style.  I love that there is customization, and yet that also becomes a point of where trouble brews.  The enemies are infinitely spawning and you have infinite ammo. Your limit is in firing intervals and reloads, before you get into viable range limitations of certain weaponry and how certain things behave. But the real issue in balance is the turrets. Despite the long reloads, the turrets can easily be multiplied in certain areas and enable you to milk the enemy spawning triggers (they start showing up once you touch the extraction point, but as you get towards your turret zone they start fading off) which makes upgrades a ton easier.  What personally bugs me though, is that the customization really isn't deep. We are in Mech Warrior levels of depth where you are really just slapping weapons onto the things, unlocking from a progression tree vs buying and unlocking parts through making due with what exists, rather than needing to swap frame and internal parts to augment and support the desired load-out or to adapt for specific combat situations. This is just a personal desire though, as I'm sure there are those who have no qualms with that design choice. I've simply been looking for certain kinds of mech game experiences that just don't exist and I'm trying to scratch an itch in my brain with what's out and nothing has been quite hitting it and I'm still working on figuring out the full scope of what the desire entails. It is OK that it doesn't fit my desires, because the vision the dev is going for was never intending to align to the desires I have. Someone is probably geeking out that someone bothered to make a Mech Warrior kind of progression mech game with unlocks like this.  That's why I will recommend this, because it is a free demo, and it plays without any hiccups as far as I can tell so far. Mech bros in the west are a nich group and so even if this isn't my type of game, gotta support other mech bro's because y'never know who may try to cater in the type of mech game design that would scratch my itch.

It's easy to get into, but managing the swarms that rush you takes solid reflexes and actually encourages a varied weapon load out.

I don't mind having to set up corner ambushes, but sometimes your only warning that there's a heavy engaging you is when fire explodes down from the north directly into your torso.

Pros: - Difficulty seems to scale as you've unlocked more tech, so you're more powerful but have more challenges - Variation of enemies means you can't just equip heavy-hitting weapons and think that you're all set - Enemy strategy varies so each engagement feels different, so the game play doesn't get too repetitive - Explosions  Cons: - I don't think the pixel-art style does it justice, as to be effective at range you're so zoomed out it just looks like normal sprites. - UI: whilst quite functional, a lot of elements look the same so it's hard to distinguish between different things, like not a lot of state difference between tech (eg. available, not available, unlocked). There is lots of white, which is overwhelming at times. - UI icons: hard to tell weapons apart by the icons. It's matching in with the pixel art I know, but... needs some work. - Would be great to have some radio-chatter and other audio elements rather than just beeps, weapons and explosions.... although that is fun.

I really recommend giving the demo a try, even the demo seems highly replayable.   Some issues I think need to be resolved are, primarily, mech speed, balancing, and audio design.   For the mech speed, they’re just too slow, the maps are too big for them and the enemies eventually get weapons that will eventually hit you no matter how quickly you move.   For balancing, I would notice that effectively there was little practical difference between, say, the Gauss rifle and rockets. Additionally the size limits on weapons isn’t a bad idea, but it was annoying that the starting tank couldn’t be fully armed for awhile due to this feature.   Finally the audio had some issues, notably for the mech. The walking sound would play for up to a few seconds after I had stopped moving, additionally it probably wouldn’t hurt to change the sound or at least turn it down a bit.

3403460,Mech Havoc: The Destructive Demo,188781998,76561198008752123,"Needs some balance tweaks, but already very fun.  First, mechs are way too slow. In the early missions, its merely annoying, because it takes too long to traverse the large maps. But once enemies with plasma cannons start showing up, its nearly impossible to dodge their extremely high damage shots. Increasing their base speed is definitely necessary. But also adding either a dash or sprint ability that increases your speed, but also reduces recoil control would also probably work well.  Second, enemy spawning and detection could be a lot better. It needs more depth than just spawning constant waves of enemies that always know exactly where you are. There should be squads of guards that defend specific areas of the map, and patrols that follow set paths throughout the enemy base. And each enemy should only know where the player is if they actually see you, or hear you.  That would allow for much more varied gameplay from mission to mission. There could be more intentional unit combinations, like frontline tanks that protect long range snipers, or short range ambushers waiting in a choke point. And some missions could focus more on being stealthy, and using limited sight lines to set up your own ambushes. While others would force you into big open brawls with limited cover.  Its fine if extra waves also spawn throughout the mission, so you'll never be wandering around with nothing to shoot at. But again, they shouldn't always know where the player is. They should either only know your general position when they first spawn, but not exactly where you are, or follow a set patrol route until they see you.  Also, the huge swarms of microscopic enemies are just annoying. They're too difficult to hit with most weapons, and because they're also barely a threat, it feels like you're just wasting time and ammo. They should be saved for specific situations, instead of just constantly swarming you throughout every single mission.",True,13,0,139,139,0,25,1740561163

3403460,Mech Havoc: The Destructive Demo,188731588,76561197964853361,"Been wishing for a game like this for ages; a Mechwarrior tank battler blended with twin-stick shooter and the top down combat of something like Door Kickers, but without throwing a bunch of manic bullet hell insanity at you in the first few minutes of gameplay.  I love how the vehicles move slowly with some lag, not responding immediately to inputs; it gives the feeling that you're operating something tanky and huge, and the gameplay is more about target prioritization than dodging between projectile salvos.  It would be nice to see more interface improvements for visibility, with more visual contrast and pings on important readouts to make things more pronounced against the background and easy to see on big screens by adding color highlights on important stuff.  I'd imagine a lot of the suggestions below could all be upgrades rather than standard features, but I think they'd be cool unlocks to have, rather than just having all unlocks being different flavors of the same weapons and vehicles.  Make priority details ping/glow/flash with brighter primary colors to contrast against the darkness, so that if something important is on screen, we don't miss it.  Little icons like exclamation marks above enemies if they get alerted to your presence, or some other kind of indicator if they call in reinforcements, as in any other stealth game where blowing your cover leads to more opponents swarming you all at once.  Perhaps some radar ping indicators with distance readouts to show if there are offscreen enemies headed your way, and they glow brighter red the closer they get. It's currently impossible to tell how much opposition you're potentially facing.  The reload meters are cool, but it would be nice to have more visual indication on them, like a countdown timer on the meter showing how many seconds to reload, a visual ping or highlight once they're reloaded, and some color to show the reload progress, e.g. red meter when ammo is low, slowly transitioning to orange and yellow in the middle, and green when it's reloaded and full. So much of the interface is just white lines, white boxes, white text, etc. and ought to be more distinctive with different colors and highlights.  Some upgrades later on that make sighting enemies easier as they become more numerous, like some red or pink target outlines to make the enemies stand out more from the background, and an enemy health meter upgrade or heat indicator that will show their overall condition.  Enemies currently give off the same orange glow that all the fires and explosions have, so you can't see them amongst wreckage, and It's hard to tell how many more hits they need to go down; those fractions of a second when deciding target priority make a difference when it comes to deciding where to direct your fire.  Some kind of movement upgrades too, not just speed upgrades but some kind of jump jet that allows you to either zip around quickly or hop over a foundation wall, rather than going the long way around or blasting your way through. Not to mention some kind of strafing technique to dodge big volleys of incoming rockets.  Would be cool to have enemy unit profiles in a glossary that explain what they are, what weapons and defenses they carry, and if they're particularly susceptible to certain types of damage or have specific weak points.  Also needs some proofreading and editing of the story text, e.g. punctuation is missing at the end of sentences in the dialog box and words are occasionally misspelled.",True,0,0,288,275,0,17,1740495568

A couple of content suggestions for the game:  - Add a passive perk system to vehicle customisation, kind of like how Starsector has ship hullmods, maybe this game could have something similar, like each vehicle has a set amount of hullmod points and different hullmods cost different amounts to equip. Have hullmods be unlockables in the tech tree, give them their own catagory.   Around 20 or 30 hullmods would add a ton of build variety to the game, they could range from simple ones that give a simple stat increase, like +50 health to more powerful ones that have trade-offs, like +50% energy weapon damage, but you move and turn 25% slower due to the added weight of the enhanced energy generator that powers your energy weapons.  - No idea if this is planned, but the full game should have Steam Workshop support and an in-game mission/map creator, so players can make custom missions for the game and then upload them for others to play, providing infinite replayerability.

3402700,noRma,186899034,76561198003013967,"Atmosphere and art is there, but it should come with a better interface and a lot better English translation.  Because the game is a sequel to a free visual novel game, the beginning bombards you with a lot of backstory. You are a detective who once solved a major case involving a scientist and his sex dolls. After developing his latest prototype, the scientist fell in love and fled with the doll. However, this doll series experienced a glitch and became violent. Long story short, you solved the case and turned off all but one of the dolls, which was reprogrammed and became your wife.  Despite the game’s unique camera angles and look, you do not have direct control over the character. The game is most convenient to play with a mouse because you still move about and interact with it using a cursor. Although the gamepad is supported, using it is difficult because you have to move the cursor slowly across the screen.  The left mouse button does the most of the work because the action changes depending on the hotspot, such as a speech bubble for characters or a cog for using anything. Everything else has a magnifying glass, prompting the main character to comment on it.  Because certain hotspots have a default action and a magnifying glass, you can switch between them with the right mouse button. The right button is also used to examine items in your inventory. There is no modern quality of life option that highlights all hotspots, so you are completely on your own.   Strangely, some hotspots do not provide any interaction. You can still see them, but no comments appear when you click on them. These hotspots may make the game more detailed, but they are also useless and a waste of time when attempting to use inventory items on them.  The characters have voices, but the tone is not satisfying. Not because of the French language, but because every voice has an unpleasant robotic filter applied to it. Most people will not understand it anyway, but the filter makes it sound too artificial and AI. There is no skipping, so when you click on something, you have to listen to the entire thing.  Due to French language, the game relies on subtitles. But the translation could use some tweaking because it’s literal, contains grammar mistakes, and sentences sound awkward in English. Sometimes text looks wrong or even feel like some of the text is missing. For instance, when you click on a television, the character says a lot but all you get for a translation is “television”.  Inventory management is standard. You simply click on an object to activate it, then select another hotspot to use it. While it is frustrating that an object is removed after an incorrect usage, forcing you to re-select it each time you wish to use it, it is far more annoying that you have to open the inventory with a separate button.  If you play with a controller, which is not recommended, all of the buttons are nearby. However, using a mouse makes for an uncomfortable experience. Instead of using the middle mouse button, you have to press the ""I"" key on the keyboard. You cannot hover the mouse to the top of the screen to display inventory or lock inventory to keep it on screen. This also means that playing with only one hand is out of the question.  Despite the problems mentioned above, the game flows nicely and is not very long. It’s more about the story than puzzles, so you don’t have to juggle with too many items. Also, you don’t have to travel between locations. You are taken to different but closed areas according to the story, and you can always check the objective list to find out what needs to be done in the current location.",True,9,0,223,182,0,1798,1738411099

But also when a giant wormed jumped out in the distance! Moments like these have already sold me to this game on the long run.  The customization also looks fun, but I had some trouble placing parts, either because it said that posts where inaccessible when they clearly had floor room, or for instance trying to place parts on an upper level cause it tried snapping on a lower level. So there's probably some room for improvement there. But I still want to figure it out and customize my wagon the way I want for sure!

However, it does seems the enemy coming at you at some point is too overwhelming, particularly the end part of mission 2 through the thunder zone, and towards the end with the warlord battle in mission 3. I can understand when its multiple small vehicles which you can take over quickly but not when there are multiple war wagons filled with 6 to 8 weapons firing on you, so total maybe 10 to 20 weapons unloading on you. Haven't replay again so unsure if its due to my driving which cause multiple group of enemies to be activated. If so, I guess they should space out the enemy group encounter zone to provide more space to drive around and engage each separately.  Other that the enemy numbers issue, overall its really fun with the vibes of Mad Max! The wagon customization is really nice. Could spend hours lost in it for fun. The crew gear and abilities as well although the demo is limited as of now to really see much. Can see the potential ahead. Just hope they can fix the enemy encounter issue.

The point being, killing you as much as possible. The game feels very difficult even from the get-go. But then it clicked - once you understand how to play around the dungeon cards and learn enemy types, the game opens up and kills you a bit less.  To briefly explain the dungeon cards - each turn a trio of dungeon cards are presented - including, events, enemies, rest sites etc. The player selects one, and the other two are discarded. But more importantly, using mulligan makes one card return to the dungeon deck, replacing it by a new card. This is critical, because you want to smartly manipulate the dungeon deck as when it runs out, the boss arrives and they are no pushover. I found this simple new mechanic fun to interact with and a refreshing alternative from the usual map with nodes layout.   The card play and decbuilding itself works well. There are some interesting combos, but nothing too crazy. The relics are plentiful and diverse, but again don't create OP combos which is a bit unfortunate.   There are 3 classes in the game, each with their own deck of cards that feels very distinct. However the Mage especially feels very weak. The game in general does have some balance problems - some cards just feel underpowered but on the other hand, some enemies when encountered as the first fight can almost kill you. Status effects like static and burn feel very weak compared to bleed and poison.  The game does feel difficult even at the base challenge level which may turn some players away, but those willing to persevere might enjoy the small but challenging deckbuilder that introduces a somewhat different feel to the usual games of the genre.    [h1][b]The positive[/b] [/h1]  + The dungeon deck is a refreshing alternative to the usual map layout.  + Decent deckbuilding options with 3 different classes to choose from.    [h1][b]The neutral[/b][/h1]  * Very reliant on memorizing enemy types.  * No resolution options.  * Mouse cursor feels heavy.   [h1][b]The negative[/b][/h1]  - At times feels very punishing if you don't get offered the right cards/items  - Slow animations  - Crashes and bugs. It's easy to get back into the game without major progress loss, but I had it happen in 50% of my games.   [h1][b]Conclusion:[/b] [/h1]  Compact deckbuilder with decent card play that can be very challenging at first.

3402160,Prisoners of Ulag'Bol: A Dungeon Crawling Deckbuilder,191862269,76561198145891369,"Prisoners of Ulag'Bol is a combat card game with rogue-like elements.  You choose from one of three classes (two start locked) and some pre-built deck options and work your way through a series of random encounters. To complete a run you will need to face a boss encounter which can be fairly varied.  Deck building options are fairly simple and each deck tends to have fairly clear goals. You can mix it up a bit by visiting merchant and getting some items to change up your strategy some, but ultimately the runs are fairly short to mid in length so if you started with a spike deck you're probably going to finish with a spike deck. Though you do sometimes get chances to make interesting combos or lean into a second direction.  The graphics are charming large blocky pixels. Some of the monsters could do with a little more fidelity, and they feel stretched in size when you meet them in the dungeon. However, they're still pretty charming. Animation is incredibly retro to match the pixel style graphics.  There are some nice quality of life features such as being able to see the monster's attacks queued up before they happen, though influencing that queue beyond blocking or placing a status effect is a little difficult.  It is possible to loss a run in advance. After a few games you will work out when this is. Typically if your health gets too low in a run, then it's time to abandon. It would be nice if there was some way to come back from this, but the runs are short enough that it isn't too punishing. The strategy is quite light, making this more of a lunch time game for people that don't have time for a run of Monster Train or Slay the Spire.  Through play, I had one crash but it's otherwise very stable. The crash didn't seem to be repeatable.  The game could do with a few new classes, and perhaps some way to influence the ""table"" of encounter cards you get. However, for a solo developed indie game it's decent. Throw the developer some cash if you want to support an indie.  Suggestions for the dev:  - More classes would be nice - Having some control over the encounters such as being able to choose a support deck would add some strategy - Currently if you take a little too much damage you need to abandon your run, it would be useful if there was a few more opportunities to get some health back (maybe camp fires give 10 - 20 extra HP?)

The pause menu feels overwhelming due to the number of options, and the lack of text explanations for certain icons can make navigation unclear. Some mechanics, like the building rocket phase, feel tedious and could be streamlined for a smoother experience. Additionally, some quality-of-life improvements, such as better camera control guidance and the ability to exit menus more intuitively, would enhance usability. There were also some bugs that impacted gameplay, such as getting stuck in the tutorial after demolishing houses and not being able to exit the building menu using the same button that opened it.

There’s a bunch of workshop items you can get, I love the Ikea shark for my cat’s bed. You can even upload your own bed now! By taking care of your screen cat, you earn stars that you can use to buy a house and a litter box for your kitty. You can also play cat and mouse with it, and boy is your cat fast. If your cat feels like it (and when all of its bars are at least half full), it can go on an adventure. You can see this by right clicking the bed. In 30-60 minutes, it will bring you a trinket it found on its adventure. The thing I love most about Screen Cat is that each of those trinkets has a short story attached to it that you can read anytime you want after you found it through an icon at the cat bed. It was a pleasant surprise.   Is this game perfect? No. I opened the game earlier today and got the achievements for buying the cat house and cat box, despite not having bought them yet.

This is a short, all-ages kinetic novel, without choices - it shares a refreshingly heartwarming scenario about gods, wishes, and sharing simple things in life. There is no lack of focus or wasted time here - every scene and detail is purposeful, even those that seem at first disconnected, and there are things worth learning about its characters. Altair was my favorite, prideful and funny, but the casual back-and-forth between the two makes for a dynamic, charming read that made me laugh more than once. It has its thought-provoking moments, too, as the characters' pasts and wishes are revealed. The art has a lively, hand-drawn feeling that conveys both the appeal of the characters, and their small everyday wonders well. This would be a perfect short movie, and I don't think anyone will come away feeling unsatisfied.  A few miscellaneous notes: Though set in modern Japan, there's no requirement to know about the culture - for those who do, there are small historical and mythological details to appreciate.

3401000,Car Mechanic Shop Simulator,191044133,76561198796595549,"Hey there, legends! Juice back with another Steam review, and today we’re looking at a game that feels like it was thrown together overnight…  🔧 CAR MECHANIC SHOP SIMULATOR 🔧 Rating: ⭐⭐☆☆☆ (2/5)  Alright, let’s cut to the chase—this is just a re skinned mobile game shoved onto Steam with a price tag. It feels like someone’s very first game ever, and honestly, that’d be fine if it were free or at least polished. But for what they’re charging? Yeah, nah.  From the moment you load in, the lack of effort is obvious—you can’t even adjust the volume in-game (only through Windows audio settings i adjust it through my obs so people watching my video didn't have their ears bleed ),  It’s like basic quality-of-life features didn’t even cross the dev’s mind.  🛠️ What’s Wrong?  ❌ Shallow, Repetitive Gameplay – The core tasks are way too simple. Click here, done. There’s no depth or actual challenge.  ❌ The Same 5 NPCs on Repeat – It’s almost funny how the same handful of customers just keep coming in, buying something, leaving, and then showing up a minute later like they forgot they were just here.  ❌ Outdated UI & Controls – The UI looks straight out of a cheap Unity tutorial, and simple things like mouse sensitivity settings are missing. and no truck dropping off your stock it just drops from the sky , It’s just lazy.   ❌ It’s Literally Just a Mobile Game Port – Everything about it screams “designed for touchscreens,” and the mechanics feel like they were built around waiting for ads or micro transactions—except now you have to pay for the game upfront.  ❌ Not Worth the Price – If this was a free-to-play game, maybe I’d be more forgiving. But when Supermarket Together offers a deeper, more complex simulation experience for free (without pay-to-win elements), this game feels like a total ripoff.  🔥 Anything Good?  ✅ It Technically Works – The game isn’t broken, but that’s about the only good thing I can say.  ✅ Runs Smoothly – It’s lightweight and runs fine… because it’s a mobile game slapped onto Steam.  🎥 Wanna See What Not to Buy? Check out my gameplay video here: 👉 https://youtu.be/bxMKnC7uvvk  (I tried to give it a fair shot, but the game just kept proving my point.)  🛒 Final Verdict  If you were hoping for a detailed car shop simulator, don’t waste your time. Car Mechanic Shop Simulator is just a lazy mobile port with minimal effort, basic mechanics, and a price tag it doesn’t deserve. There are way better free games that do the same thing but better.  Final Score: 2/5 – Skip it unless it goes free. ",False,3,0,110,110,0,24,1742783840

There is an economy, but people sometimes give absolutely not logical amounts of money for something, with a price of $100 they can give $150.5 looks a little strange. It's great that there's a card payment option, but unfortunately it's only available at the checkout, and there's also a bug with the game crashing when you take cash for selling a motorcycle or for car service. There are a lot of products, but the basis of the store is tires and wheels for cars. There are not enough categories and at least some sort of sorting. There's also a bug where NPCs prevent each other from passing and get stuck right at the entrance, but it's not fatal.  Personally, I lack achievements on Steam, it would be nice to implement it. In general, it's a rather mediocre game, with a low price and requiring a lot of improvements. I hope the developers read the reviews. We are waiting for patches and sequels, as the game is quite crude and you can make product categories + sorting, it would also be possible to add cars and more characters that would not interfere with each other's walk. There is a lack of music volume settings and the ability to jump, for example (sometimes you need to look at the top shelf).

I list a few things so you know why, but TL;DR: The game has a very little set of features, empty, rushed and boring, rinse & repeat left and right.  [list] [*] Boring, empty environment, boring, empty everything, the same 3 or 4 faces visit the shop (same clothing and everything), kinda in the same pace, leading to my next point  [*] Very, very monotone gameplay: Even the things above mentioned characters buy are always very similar, 1 or 2 items, similar combinations  [*] One music track, guess what, that's, even though a nice one (yet ""heard it somewhere"", I believe it's one of those free tracks from the net) also boring after a while  [*] The shop itself is boring as well, without the promise it will ever be any different: same walls, same shelves, same everything, only the shop size and number of shelves grow  [*] Very slow profit generation, likely to make the game last longer. What I mean is, there will be no reasonable expansion: growing number of tasks (e.g. janitor work, emptying the trash can, fixing a shelf or changing a bulb, etc.), so after a while need to hire people (not a thing), therefore, the little content is behind a ""progress wall""  [*] Lack of expanding the shop for the customers, like coffee or soda machine, a corner where they can chill, stuff like this, maybe even free coffee or candies, i.e. small profit loss but more customers in return, or basically anything that would give depth to the game. Nothing like that. Looked into this assuming I might have missed something in my short demo-play but I didn't. In my 1.2 hours of game play I've seen everything, except for 'n' more part types I can put on shelves...  [*] Not even day-night cycle to give a sense of time passing, which is an extremely easy thing in any game engine. My guess here is, the place look horrible on any other light levels, and / or errors are revealed (e.g. colliding meshes or box labels casting shadow on boxes, etc.), so the dev / studio decided to set exactly one light level and call it a day. A cheap, very, very cheap day...  [*] Storing items is not just silly, it's also an insult when one tries to retrieve them. The same mechanic is executed as for ordering, so click the storage door, ""retrieve"" the stored item and instead of that happing, a box is spawned outside the shop like it was an ordered item... So walk outside again, take the box inside, fill the shelf, rinse and repeat...  [*] Placing items on the shelves can be teadious as not clicking the perfect spot the game 'thinks' one wants to take an item back (i.e. same button to place and to take back items, so it's pixel-hunting on a degree initiating the right action type)  [*] There's a corner with a sofa, coffee cups and a small table. For no apparent reason... Nobody use that, paper cups cannot be taken and thrown away, can't sit down, nothing's on...  [*] No volume control in the Audio menu. The game is far too loud, can't maintain that  only in OS or on hardware, it's also cheap  [*] Unity Engine. Horrible thing, giant load on hardware even for the smallest game so it feels like playing games written in that """"engine"""", are a waste of electricity bill and hardware lifetime... (Sure, there are games in better engines in lower quality, but still) [/list]  All in all, this could have been a decent game, as the little they added are fun for about an hour or so, but that's all, they stopped adding content and caring about the title, released it as is in hope it's good enough... Issue is, at least a full year of hard work is missing from this game if not more (assuming it's a small studio if not a one-man-army), and as they rushed the release I strongly doubt this effort will ever be added, also if minding the capabilities of Unity, even if a game is very well optimized (spoiler alert: this game was not).",False,0,0,70,70,0,154,1741807696

Pros: - Very simple and easy - The graphics are smooth - The game play isn't overly complicated  Cons: - There is no option to open your basket to remove an item from the shopping cart so you have to just clear the cart instead if you make a mistake or miscalculate the cost. - The basket doesn't save when you come out of the laptop (This is not game breaking but i like the option to add things as i go and then checkout once I have saved the money) - When checking out if you accidentally click on too much change you have to reset it. there is no option to just click on the bill and remove however much you need too. (Again not game breaking but its the little things)  I know the Full version of the game will be offering more game play from reading the About section and I think once things are added it could be thoroughly enjoyable. I like the idea of being able to offer maintenance on cars, I'm hoping that will include MOTs, oil changes, tire changes maybe even parts being fitted. I also hope it will add the option to hire people to help run the shop otherwise you are stuck serving and not much chance for anything else as you have a steady stream of people coming in.  I'd love it if you could take custom orders from people if you don't have the stock just to add something extra to the game to set it apart from other simulator games out there.

I had a lot of fun in story mode, and when it came out, I saw people posting their cool and weird creations since I follow LimboLane on social media.  My fun was pretty dramatically cut short when I decided to hop into creative mode and attempt to make my girlfriend, for fun. The game's price tag of zero dollars and zero cents was pretty heavily advertised, so imagine my disappointment when they locked probably half or more of the game's customization options behind a paywall in creative mode. Very much got freemium vibes from it, stopped being fun pretty immediately after I saw that and I haven't been able to pick it back up since then.  I get that LL has to make money, but this game was originally free iirc, and I genuinely think I would have had more fun if they removed all the premium customization options and just gave away this port for free (a la Sonic Unleashed dumping all the files for the game for PC for free) instead of trying to hustle you into buying DLC. Cheapens the experience of the game by a wide margin.  I don't mind paying for LL games. I bought Great God Grove because I was really excited for it and loved SFM. But because it was so heavily advertised as free and then turned out to be ""free, as long as you want the ability to actually use creative mode and have fun with it to be locked behind a paywall ;)"" I had a way worse time than if they had sold it for money, or just taken out the new stuff and made it actually free.",False,2,1,130,130,0,3,1741825393

I think the game need like 8 minutes to reach each boss? - I haven't tried the multiplayer mode since I have no friend to play with but i think there is a bug there where you can just play it even if there is no second player coming?

3400480,Tower Dominion Playtest,186554298,76561198301143433,"simply this is a TD with rouglike elements, for a playtest this game already has HUGE variety for towers, commanders, and even settings.  Of course it isn't perfect for example there are just far too many commanders which isn't bad by itself but many have borderline useless or far too specific and unreliable passives to rely on and for many towers you need to first play a game with them to unlock their level ups which makes you avoid picking them up since they'll essentially be dead weight for the run.  As for the positives, there is so much variety, no run feels the same, the terrain cards you get bring a fun degree of randomness that shape your run to be unique and make you adapt on the fly. For me, personally, I have fun in the slow build up of my defences and watching the combat unfold taking my time to plan optimal placements.  The difficulty is also really challenging, and the best part is that the increasing difficulties doesn't just effect the hp of enemies, it effects the amount of lanes you have to defend which makes for a far more challenging run, and the highest difficulty really challenging, I just beat my first difficulty IV run after 11.5 hours and 10 of those were spent trying to beat difficulty IV exclusively. Most of my losses were due to death by a thousand cuts where small misplayes ended up accumulating and I'd lose the run half an hour in, but I didn't mind, the journey to victory was fun by itself and made the victory taste so much sweeter.  Some annoyances that I expect will be patched out for full release are that the vsync launches turned on but I need to toggle it off and on again for it to actually take effect and mitigate pc fan speeds. Sometimes when selecting a building and then switching to another the range of the previous is still displayed making it difficult to judge the distance of the new tower. Sometimes enemies got stuck at the spawn point and were untargettable by towers making me wait for the infantry charge to kill them, the issue got fixed by quickly relaunching the run. The different varieties of splitting horrors will count as the wave complete when you split a bigger type into smaller parts if it's the final enemy for the wave, sometimes the split enemies stay in a state of animation and wait for the next wave to start to begin moving again, this has actually saved me a couple of times letting my defences reload to blast them next to my HQ upon the new wave.  In conclusion my enjoyment has been immense and this addiction has been unfortunate timing with exams having ended just today  edit: I should mention I found out about this playtest by the YT algorithm suggesting me LoveYaCoffee's video on it  edit edit: I forgot to mention the sound design, which I personally really love the chaos of all of the explosions and gunfire and haven't gotten tired from it yet, the music is nice and funky though I have put my own music on after a multi run session",True,0,0,2223,886,10,4,1738005948

The chaotic gameplay keeps every session exciting, and my viewers had a blast watching me stream it.  One thing that makes this game special to me is its voice recognition.

PROS: -tech tree is developed enough to want to achieve most things -multiple enemy root types to encounter add fun replayability -root concept is very satisfying to clear large swaths by attacking uproot.  CONS: -there's no way to add units or buildings to hotkeys, if you lose track of a unit, you'll never find it again. -there's no way to queue up actions, if you want your units to attack more than one specific area you have to wait until the first attack is done, then select the next area.  -if a building is queued to be built, but you change your mind, even if it hasnt started building yet cancelling the queue costs 50% resources. just queued a really long wall while the game is paused and want to change your mind? too bad. -you cannot select a path for your units to follow, just a single point, meaning if you cleared a path and are reinforcing, they will take the shortest path through roots and die instead of being able to queue a path through the cleared area. -units dont target the roots that are spreading the growth, they just randomly target whatever, so you have to select exactly what to target.  Devs please take a look at how Starcraft 2 handles the controls for building, unit movement, and unit control. It's a perfect system. being able to hold 'Shift' while clicking to queue movements, and being able to 'A' move to attack into an area without driving into the roots, yet still proceeding forward when the roots are cleared would be essential for an RTS like this.

It would be more immersive if you'd hear the sounds of buildings that are working, like the miners grinding and stuff. Just a small nitpick. [*]Speaking of sound, and this is a nitpick again, but some of the explosions and cannonfire sound a little underwhelming. The artillery cannon for example would sound more badass if the firing and the explosion of the shell made alouder, more ""booming"" sound. [*]The idea of having easy unit formations is really nice [*]I'm glad the ore doesn't run out. The income is just reduced meaning the turtler that I am can take my time to slowly expand without too much pressure. However, I've seen a few people complain that it makes it too easy.

With additional development, I would spend $25-$40 on it.    The early game is quite challenging. It is hard to get enough minerals to make gold before they enemy is at your doorstep.  It seems essential to make use of an early medium tank to counter the Pink acid spitters.  Early rush of light tanks to temporarily block key choke points proved invaluable.    Late game, the artillery is devastating, but ultimately useless if you are aiming to hit that 60 minute completion challenge.  They just cost too much and take too much time to deploy.  Artillery towers provide maximum security for your base, but again I'm not sure it is worth the cost if you are aiming to do the 60-minute completion.  Recommendations would be 1. Fix the end game link to take you back to the Title Menu (it doesn't work) 2. Fix the fatal crash error  3. Lower the cost of the artillery (or the artillery tower) 4. Implement flying enemies and buildable units 5. Implement enemies that 'snag' light tanks and pull them into the vines 6. Allow solar panels to be upgradable into the Tier 2 solar panel 7.

Found myself saying things like ""cut the vine, with surgical artillery strikes"", as such some mild strategy involved. Rushed a later second squadron in to cut near the root from the canyon giving my main force free passage to the root.  Would recommend the demo for a few hours play, and would be interested in the game.  Thoughts for the developer: 1) Needs the C&C harvester and refinery system, for the gemstones really. 2) The increased power and gems building should be a radius not touching. 3) never built the advanced solar panel - no need - maybe on a larger map? 4) Needs a second tier of tanks or a more powerful machine guns / tank aka ""C&C Mammoth tank"" 5) Needs an airforce (Expensive) accessible after artillery in cost - Helicopter machine guns, Mig jet return to base cannon aka tank unit, expensive single shot return to base stealth bomber aka artillery unit. 6) The plants actually don't provide much of a threat. The pink shooting is good, but its weak against units. Hope you have a stronger yellow plant developed and or several other varieties. 7) The way the plants grow and box themselves in is good, green boxing pink in. e.g. heading north on a map you encounter increasing tiers of plant, if you cut / kill a green vine you have consequences of fighting the higher tiers sooner when your not as developed. (on a second run through, played the central island with two entrances, used my 1st artillery to cut pink, allowing green to grow in its place, which meant my refineries on the left ore patch were not getting shot at) 8) A lot of the enjoyment is going to come down to map design, also on larger maps the airforce mentioned would make it less grindy. 9) A building at higher tier to revel ore on the mini map through the creep or something like that is needed to help plan, rather than remember. 10) low ore regeneration would be good.  Final Thought after reading a few reviews regarding the AI and auto targeting. You would loose a lot of strategy if the tanks and artillery auto targeted the main vines. Please don't implement this. Looks to me as you have 3 stages of plant. green machine gun fodder, the mid vines and the main branch. Tanks / Artillery should default to clearing the mid tier only, or what ever the nearest threat is. Artillery shooting at the main vines looses the ability to plan when to make the cut, then rush your units to reinforce or approach the main root. Please ignore those who simply don't get how to play.

First I'd add some barracks and training facilities along with infantry. Second, I'd scrap the campaign in it's entirety. It's an out there statement but campaign modes take up a lot of time and resources to develop and usually not revisited once complete. Personally, I'd go 100% skirmish and concentrate on the AI and adding a plethora of maps and good PvP support.

Its a demo, so I have high hopes for significant enhancement of controls. I love the concept and complexity. Although once understood, becomes repetitive in the demo at least.

The pink is the number one target, if you can push it back and then let green move in, you're set forever, provided you have proper defenses. I found myself rushing initially to get ahead of the Calyx, at least in this demo, it is unnecessary, just need to get to steady state with forces holding back at the same rate of growth, then you have all the time you need, provided you can break out to the next mine before exhausting current mines.",True,0,0,787,787,0,3,1739022908

As someone who spent a good portion of his childhood playing games like C&C and AoE, this game really hit a lot of those old feels. Played the scenario mission twice, very intuitive game play, not to complicated to understand.   At first it was a calm start and 10 minutes in I quickly realized that I was effectively locked in. The rate at which the enemies expand is really fascinating and didn't at all cause panic, mainly just a sense of urgency. I didn't feel afraid at any point during the game, mostly just felt the tension knowing that a simple mistake could lead to some of my units being encircled.   Tip for anyone struggling on that scenario mission, center spawn, couple arty vehicles, easy to win. Initially contain the purple-pink spitter type enemy to its area, allow the green to lock it in. Keeps all active attacking enemies away. All that's left is an easily containable green enemy, hold them back until you're ready to make an offensive.  Try it, its free and its good.

3400850,Calyx Demo,186972440,76561197997601092,"Very promising. I've enjoyed the Creeper World series a great deal and Calyx appears to be a fresh take on the idea of taking on a creeping, mindless enemy that consumes everything in its path. This time you're a proper RTS faction, rather than a tower defence in a charming hat and coat.  Liked: Proper RTS units and controls.  The Calyx itself is suitably menacing and the animation for the little vines and roots are lovely.  Watching the Calyx fade away when you sever one of its roots is always satisfying.  Needs improvement: Unit AI is not yet finished. They currently stare at flowers which spawn and shoot at them without shooting back. Tanks don't prioritise roots. Sometimes they just... don't respond, especially when the Calyx gets near.   Early game is quite slow. It feels like 2/3 of the match goes by before you're able to make any inroads against the threat.  Targeting can be a bit wonky. Many times I thought I'd clicked a root only to have my tanks pummel the patch of ground 5m to the left of it. Units sometimes ignore attack commands or shoot at a target once or twice, then take a mandated smoke break. Tank unions are out of control.  ======================== Overall, I'm excited to see what this develops into.  I'll definitely be looking for this one when it releases.",True,2,0,310,310,0,13,1738481803
3400850,Calyx Demo,186939521,76561199102218998,"Overall I really liked this game, I beat the first mission and had fun while doing it. I cut it pretty close with building my defenses on time but the game allowed me to do that. This game is designed very well and didn't feel boring or uninteresting at any point. I would like to point out though that there are some features in the game that are not explained in the tutorial.  Here are a few things I learned while playing that the game doesn't tell you:  1. The calyx work off of a root system (core--->big--->medium--->small) small grass-like roots rely on medium roots to grow, medium dark brown (or pink bush) roots rely on big roots to grow, and big tan (or pink) colored roots rely on the core to grow. They all, except for the grass, has a growth radius where the smaller root will grow. If you cut off the source of the roots they will disappear after a short time. If 2 roots growth radius's overlap then you will have to destroy both to get rid of the overlap area.  2. Mines will still produce resources after the deposit runs out and the mine will take less energy when doing so (if it mines at 10% then it will take only 10% of usual energy) which means you should NOT deconstruct mines. With that said you will only get 50% resources back from deconstructing buildings.  3. If you click on the HQ you can spend resources to increase unit capacity  4. 2 different types of calyx will not overlap, so if you can you want to position you defenses so that you are fighting a weaker version of the calyx (which in the current demo is the green). I am not sure if 2 of the same calyx will overlap or not but I would assume they do not.  5. (this one is more of a tip) You do not NEED walls to hold back the calyx, if you build enough turrets in the early game you can hold them back with just those. With that said you should try to wait until the last second to build defenses so that your economy can improve first  6. If you select your ore transport you can click ""launch now"" to have it immediately start collecting ore to send off (or you can set ""reserve"" to 0). This is important in the early game when you are not building defenses and don't need the ore. You can also set the amount of ""reserve"" it will wait for until is launches. ""reserve"" is how much minerals you have over 100 (if reserve is 50 than the rocket will launch at 150 minerals). It is good to set a reserve in the mid-game when energy and minerals are sparse. reserve has no effect on how much minerals the rocket takes with it, rather it determines how often it launches.  7.(also another tip) be careful when speeding up the game, your defenses can be overwhelmed if you are not paying attention. Make sure to get medium tanks out as soon as soon as possible in order to counter the larger roots (you will need 1-2 depending on the size of the choke point.  Most of these things should be touched upon in the tutorial (maybe add an optional advanced tutorial) but I was able to figure these things out by playing the game. Add a comment if you think there is anything else that new players should know or if I misunderstood a mechanic.",True,4,0,201,157,0,4,1738444865

Played the demo through, lost a few times trying to get a feel for the game.   It plays some what like Creeper World 4 but sets itself apart quite a bit. The Calyx (enemy faction) feels alive much like creeper does but instead of a fluid feel, Calyx feels rigid and hard. This makes it feel more like you are fighting a tree that's growing around you. The way it grows and almost adapts to you out of trial and error is very interesting. The Calyx would be much more threatening if it was coded in a way to grow a root around a spot that a root was previously destroyed multiple times instead of having the chance of it happening. In my winning session I could set up an artillery to fire on one spot and not have to worry about that choke point unless the root got lucky and grew around that spot, which was rare. Breaking large stems that have a ton of growth linked to them is incredibly satisfying.  While I do enjoy the game-play loop I don't see many ways they could expand on it and keep the player engaged for more than a few missions. Creeper World had the same problem for me once I completed story. I'm sure the full version will have more of a campaign and I'm interested to see how they plan on making each mission interesting.  The visuals are nothing ground breaking but are simple and enjoyable. I did not get any eyestrain during my 2.5+ hrs of playing, which tends to happen if the textures are too ""busy"" in top down games. The models for the units and buildings are nice and look good when zoomed in. The animations are simple but well made. I like the little tank units they are incredibly effective at staving off the new growth and protecting your artillery. The artillery units are the most satisfying by far and really effective, too effective I think.   To me it felt impossible to gain much headway without the artillery, but then it became too easy once I obtained it. i feel the finished game would benefit from having a smaller artillery vehicle you could research for a lower cost that has similar range but lower damage. Lack of units is one of the things I hope the full game will address. Lack of diversity in enemy types is a problem too. The only real threat other than your own inattention is the shooter worm things which you can keep down with one medium tank. I'm sure the full game will solve this too but wanted to point it out now for the demo. I didn't find a way to grid build the power pylons so i hope they add that, its super tedious to place them one by one evenly spaced out. My FINAL grievance is just WAY too much text for the story. I read the first two pages the had to skip ahead.

This review goes into spoilers below, as I am intending this as constructive criticism for the devs.  Firstly, about the cases themselves, the first case is pretty decent for a first case, it does feel a bit 'dry' in some ways and I think the way the search mechanic is used in this case feels like you need to just look up random things until you find something, but I liked the mystery and it was decent difficulty.  Unfortunately however, every case past this point for me was solvable in less than a minute, as there's extremely few available words and the situations showcased are extremely basic with little twists. The single other actual unique point of difficulty past the first case is noticing the ghost in the final case to lock in a paranormal answer, and that's not very hard. While I did erroneously put in the 'basic' answer for the second-to-last case, I'm not sure if there's anything in that case to actually tell anything paranormal is happening, beyond knowing that the case after has paranormal events.   On that note, I'm unsure about the potential of the 'basic' vs. 'paranormal' answer mechanic of this game. While it leading to diverging cases in some situations and encouraging replay is neat, from what I've seen of it so far, I don't really see much unique creative potential in it, and see it more potentially stifling the type of cases that can be written, and diverging cases leads to less focus in case creation I believe. (the 2 available diverging cases in the game can be solved in almost no time.)  Overall, while I think the premise has potential, every case except the first is incredibly easy and has basically nothing to solve, which worries me about what the final game may look like, along with the fact that I'm not sure the main mechanic of the game is actually a good idea. Beyond my worry of the cases, I also think that the searching mechanic in its current state feels like it needs to be somewhat brute forced in the one case it's actually deeply used, case 1, and there's a lot of typos and somewhat unnatural writing.",False,0,0,40,40,0,15,1742250834

You are tasked to investigate possible extraordinary phenomenon across the world, and you observe your subjects in the most secure and professional manner possible: through their window.  [b] Window of Perspective DEMO [/b] is a location investigation game. Similar to the [i]Curse of the Golden Idol[/i], you are plopped into a location either during or right after an event with little fanfare. Click on objects to collect words to fill in the blanks of a report. In addition to that, you can plop words into a rudimentary search engine to possibly find relevant articles on the internet (like [i]The Roottrees are Dead[/i]). What takes it the extra distance is the vague sense of unease in how you interpret the scene, as there seems to be supernatural elements popping up with some frequency. Is the dead person a victim of a bloodthirsty vampire attack, or is it just an abusive ex boyfriend? Most scenes have a normal observation and a supernatural observation, and your conclusions effect future scenes, adding a fun twist and some replay-ability in the chaotic scenes.  The search engine is a little wonky, as there isn't a tutorial outside of a vague ""hint"" box. Also, it seems overly stringent on which words are ""correct"" even if multiple ones seem like they should work. For example, one student's name [say, Tom] brings up an article with two students [Tom and Bob] in it, but the other student's name doesn't bring up the same article [Bob].

Im still trying to really learn the other 2 out of the 3 initial factions before i try to learn another.   However i can definitely say ive gotten my monies worth with this one. For 8 dollars USD even with out playing the faction myself ive had them pop up as a random faction in my skirmish games just about every time ive done a skirmish match since getting the dlc and i gotta say in comparison to the other faction i find them one of the tougher challenges to overcome. Dont think theyre overpowered from fighting them but theyre definitely no push over.  So yeah like i said i havent even gotten around to playing this faction as of yet but just having them as opponents in skirmish alone, to me, in my opinion has been worth every penny. And ill only get that much more out of it once i get the courage to finally learn and play the faction for myself.  im typically not a fan of single faction dlc in most strategy games but some do it right and i think its been done right with this.

I grew up in Montana and in my youth, had a very strong love of anime and anime tropes. Games such as Wild Arms, Boot Hill Heroes, Westerado, and something like The Real Texas are that niche genre that are my wheelhouse. I've always had a love for that clash of atheistic, and when I heard of this game a while back I threw it up on my wishlist without a second thought, this was going to be something special. The mechanics and minute to minute gameplay are similar to what you might find in the Evolution games for the Dreamcast/Gamecube. You got yourself a hub town and you got yourself some dungeon delving, go out and grind. So far it has been a lovely experience, especially at the price point. The graphics are done in a voxel style which I've always been a big fan of so if you like the charm that has to offer you'll be on board. So far my only request to the dev would be to please put an auto-battle feature. The combat reminds me of a Dragon Quest or Earthbound and I think it could really help the whole of the time spent, since grinding is so needed to have a feature such as that. If you enjoyed Boot Hill Heroes, if you enjoyed Wild Arms this is a unique opportunity to pick up something else that has that same panache but with its own twists. To Kevin Musto I hope you continue to update and tweak this and I look forward to what you do in the future.

For the sake of not just shitting on the game without any actual feedback however, I'll add my personal thoughts. Let me start of with the one positive I have: I really liked the aesthetic of the winding, twisting corridors. Those were neat.  Now, onto the bad. The very first ""puzzle"" is basically just a guessing game on the order of the door bolts to click on after the 1st. That, in turn, feels like it was solely put there as a setup for the cheap jumpscare you get barely one minute into playing, and it doesn't get any better from there.  The premise of this being a dream/nightmare feels like an excuse to simply throw together a bunch of random locations and assets because ""dreams are nonsensical and weird"", but it just doesn't work if the atmosphere doesn't match and there is barely even a semblance of a fleshed out plot or lore either. There was nothing there that drew me in, and nothing that made me want to continue playing.  The second puzzle was alright, but the third made me stop playing. The knife shapes on the padlock were extremely hard to see because of the bright light right next to it, and even with the limited knife shape options, I eventually just gave up and quit the game. I ended up watching a playthrough to see if pushing through that puzzle was worth it, and nothing I saw after that third puzzle piqued my interest to make me dive back in myself.  At best, I was almost bored, and at worst, I was frustrated. Some people may definitely find enjoyment in this, especially if you're not looking for a story-heavy game or challenging gameplay, but it's not for me and I don't think I'll be returning for any future chapter of this mannequin nightmare-plagued protagonist anytime soon.",False,3,0,21,21,0,13,1736849263

3399700,Parkour Assassin: Sprint Run,190678043,76561198030784015,"[quote][b][url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_flip]Warning: Asset Flip![/url][/b] Parkour Assassin: Sprint Run is a Digital Homicide style asset flip, or what Valve calls a ""Fake Game"". The ""developer"" paid for/pirated a few Unreal Marketplace assets, dumped them all in a blender, and submitted it to Valve as if they're real game developers.[/quote]  Two notable criteria for what makes an asset flip instead of legitimate use of stock assets are whether those assets comprise the majority of the game, and whether the ""developer"" properly credited the people who created most of the assets in the game.  This game fails both of those tests.  The ""developers"" here didn't credit any of the artists and real, actual game developers who created the assets here, so this is plagiarism, as well as cash grab shovelware.  In this case, the asset flipper took a bunch of basic stock Unreal assets and dumped them on a basic Unreal first person game blueprint, assembling a few assets lazily to make a basic platformer.  Every now and then China has a weak attempt at knocking Russia from the throne of ""worst country to pollute Steam with asset flips"", and they fail, but this was a nice attempt.  Really, China and Brazil are tied for second place.  Sorry China, Russia wins.  Anyway the point of that was just to emphasise that this is just another valueless, garbage asset flip cash grab and you shouldn't buy it.  It has no value or merit as a real game.  Taking this shovelware seriously as if it was a genuine attempt to make a game, it doesn't meet basic minimum requirements that most PC gamers expect as standard.  There's no option to change the resolution and no useful graphics tweaks.  There's no way to ensure this is running at the native resolution of your display.  There's no guarantee this game will look right on any PC as a result of this hamfisted design decision.  The mismatched game assets are fairly mediocre/low quality, it's a wonder why they couldn't be bothered ""borrowing"" higher quality assets for this asset flip.  This is a lot like going on a shoplifting spree but only stealing the cut price store brand goods.  Regardless, the poor quality assets alone should be enough to deter gamers from bothering with this.  The controls can't be customised, which will be an annoyance for many, but it can also render the game unplayable for differently-abled gamers, left handed gamers or gamers using AZERTY or other international keyboard layouts.    These technical defects push this game below acceptable standards for any modern PC game.  The poor quality of this game is reflected by how many people spent time with it.  At the time of this review, SteamDB shows the all-time peak player number was only 2 players.  This is a remarkably low number, and now, the only player activity occurs once or twice a month, presumably someone loading it up to see what it is then quickly uninstalling it.  Considering there's over 120 million gamers on Steam and well over 110,000 games for gamers to choose from, the overwhelming lack of interest in this low quality game is to be expected.  This kind of asset flipping isn't harmless.  It makes it harder for gamers to find genuinely made games from ethical developers.  It makes it harder for genuine indie developers, who put hard work into trying to make real games, to find an audience for their products.  It gives indie developers a bad name.  So, should you buy this asset flip?  Is this better than any of the 110,000+ genuinely made games on Steam?  Of course not!  Parkour Assassin: Sprint Run is relatively cheap at $4 USD, but it's not worth it. Given the defects and quality issues with the game, coupled with the unrealistic price, and the questionable ethical nature of the developer and/or their associates (as outlined above), this is impossible to recommend.  Remember that if you buy a game from an unethical developer, you're putting your money at risk.

The voice acting is satisfactory, though it is evident that different microphones were used by most actors, and some audio adjustments could enhance the experience. Nevertheless, for a free game, it exceeds expectations.  Throughout the gameplay, players encounter the personal stories of various characters and their perspectives on life. The dialogue tree resets with each new conversation, making it easy to explore all dialogue options, but this can also render the interactions somewhat trivial.

The game is based on a fantasy that everyone has had at some point: what would happen if contemporary soldiers and weapons confronted ancient arsenals. Although the game provides a modest sample, it turns out that machine guns are not very effective against spears and swords.  Because the game is still in early access, some of the features might be missing. You control a lone soldier who is trapped in an arena or battlefield with enemies coming at you from all sides. The objective is to move around and let your soldier fire at on its own. There is no need to collect something or accomplish objective; all you have to do is survive long enough to end the wave.  Waves become more challenging. While the first waves feature archers and melee fighters, the later waves include armored spearmen and knights. Enemies are a little squishy because they require a lot of bullets to bring down, and it’s impossible to leave a battle unscathed. The whole this is pretty difficult; it’s a challenge to survive even 10 waves on the easiest difficulty.   Money from killing enemies can be used in the store before the next wave. Here, you are given three random perks, but you can also replenish the store with new perks for a fee. If you can not buy something right now, you can lock it for five coins to ensure it’s available after the next wave. However, you must avoid pressing the lock again, as this will result in the loss of another five coins.   There are numerous perks that improve various stats, including speed, armor, and damage. However, some have a downside that is not always worth it. For example, leg armor increases defense by three points but reduces dodge by five. You also have perks that are a waste of money because they only work with specific weapons. So, if you have a machine gun and purchase a shotgun perk, you will not benefit from it.  Some perks enable limited attacks, such as artillery or helicopter attacks. They recharge after each wave, but they can be dangerous because they cause damage to your unit. Furthermore, each use costs a significant amount of money. Using them is another problem because you click on them on the bar at the bottom of the screen. But while you can see the cost, you don’t know what the attacks do or what they even are.  The most essential option in the store is new units. There are numerous professions, such as cop, cowboy, mechanic, and so on. Each unit has perks and cons, but having another soldier to guard your back is always beneficial.   However, purchasing a unit alone is not enough; you must also purchase a weapon that can show up among the perks. Although its benefits will still apply, you will not be able to bring it into fight until you arm it. Your unit can include up to six troops who share a life bar. It gradually restores health, but the run ends when you lose everything. The unit is slow and must reload, therefore you easily take hit from fast and ranged units.  One element that is missing is the ability to review purchased perks. When you buy a perk, all you see are green and red numbers in the stats indicating a change. You also cannot check units or weapons, although you can swap weapons between units. Another major issue is that you are unable to sell weapons or units and must instead discard them. It is frustrating to waste a unit with strong stats because you don’t know what they are.  There is no meta-progress, although you can acquire new starting unit and weapon. However, whereas weapons can be unlocked simply by purchasing them during a run, units are a hassle due to an unknown requirement.

3398200,Pacifish: Recast,187610541,76561199043398218,"(Last edited: Fish Clicker Update)  First, you need to know that there's a free version of the game, and this is the remake of that. Both are the same game at its core. Look at the vids and screenshots of both games; they showcase actual game content, so you can see what to expect.  For those who have played the original (free) version, I'm going to point out what's different in the remake by splitting it into three categories: [b]changes, new content, and scrapped content[/b]. I've 100%-ed both games, so I'm confident I've seen most of the content (if not everything) that both games are offering.  [b]Changes:[/b]  - Recast leans more towards the incremental aspect of the game compared to the original (which kinda feels more like an idler). This means making money by leaving the game completely unattended is much harder. It's still a side activity game; you just need to click in more frequently now. - The Pavilion DLC is now a part of the base game with a new multiplier system to increase the reward. - Rebalancing of various item costs and effects. Imo most of them are good, but YMMV. - Some things have been renamed. For example, the Swedish Fish. - Baits have been changed into only a single kind; it lets you catch items in large numbers. - You can now eat every fish and spread the upgrade points to any available stat of your liking. - The Hatchery now lets you customize three slots instead of two (it only keeps the sun fish slot as non-customizable). - Improved Fight mode with the newly introduced fishing gear and drop rate system. - The Swimmer no longer has a health system nor obstacles to kill you, so it's easier to farm. But the bar is smaller, and you can no longer phase through the sides to reach the opposite ends. - Changes on the visuals in general. Recast is running on Godot while the original is on Unity, so a lot of readjustments were made. If you think Recast is kinda lacking in the sprite department, that's because the dev said the sprite artists had moved on to bigger jobs. If you think the font is smaller or outright unreadable, the dev is currently looking at the issue. If you think there's a lot of empty spaces in some areas and too much clutter in other areas, well... Imho the visuals are mostly a downgrade from the original, but again, YMMV. - The Fish Clicker is back with new passive trinket system. It still relies on limited events.  [b]New content:[/b]  - New offline resource gain feature by the means of a net, which is upgradeable in the Workshop. - New endgame map and mechanics to sink your resources into, plus a new NPC. Check the vid and the screenshots. - New collection tracker and some lore (or ""flavor texts"" according to the dev). - New title system to replace your fisher name. - Boosts: temporary power-ups that will speed up your timer. - Lootboxes in the Market! No, it won't cost you real money (you're already paying for this game). They contain resources to help with your progress. - More achievements than the original. - A new feature related to the black orb (won't spoil). - Supposedly a better save system (I don't see the difference from the old one, though).  [b]Scrapped content:[/b]  [strike]- The Fish Clicker.[/strike] It's added now. - That little shell-hunting game. - That little bit with Sam. - The Abyss (you know what it is if you've 100%-ed the original).  Now, my [u]personal[/u] verdict.  Do I think this remake is an improvement of the original? Yes. Do I recommend this game? Yes. Do I prefer this version more than the original? Sadly, no. Not because it's bad, just a personal preference.  Pacifish Recast is a well-made incremental game and definitely performs better as that kind of game than the original. Just like the original, it's a fun game to keep as a side activity when doing something else. The reason why I prefer the original over Recast is because I was looking for an idle game when I picked up the original Pacifish. The original is a better idler, visually better, and I have access to the scrapped content, which I actually like (not the Fish Clicker, though; sorry, clicker lovers). [Edit: The Fish Clicker is now in Recast. My opinion about it is still unchanged.] Obviously, the issue lies in my personal taste and not the remake.  So if you want more automation/idler, play the original. If you want more incrementals play Recast. If you enjoy the work of this dev and just wanna support him because he's just a chill dude and willing to listen to feedback, consider buying whatever he has to offer.",True,3,0,20997,5951,4379,9,1739164449

This does however come at the cost of the 3 slot + 4 slot trailer combo i mention in the review below, while the TerraPro gets to keep it, you can however still use a crane, bed and trailer combo if you'd like to.  While the TerraPro is still my favourite of the two, that's purely based on bias now instead of actual performance, as the Pinnacle has finally claimed it's Heavy Duty title.  [hr][/hr] Clearly intended for early/midgame maps, as they're Highway (TerraPro) and Heavy Duty (Pinnacle) classification, attempt to treat them as anything more and you're in for a rough time.  Both vehicles manage a 3 slot sideboard bed and are able to tow trailers with the TerraPro's bed being paintable. Neither uses other 3 slot modules though, sadly, it would be nice to see the extended fuel tank or maintenance module here. The Pinnacle also has a unique medium log and crane combo which looks nice, the medium log frame is also painted black and yellow, it's log crane is also able to be used with modules like the fuel tank, which may see some niche use parked at a logging plant on hard mode.  Both vehicles lack AWD hence my earlier warning, both have difflock but only the Terra Pro's is always on, the strongest tires these trucks get are OHDs but if i'm not mistaken the unique tires ever so slightly trump them.  Out of both though the Highway bound TerraPro cements itself as my favourite of the two, since it's got alot of clearance with it's raised suspension, meaning those mountain roads won't be having you getting stuck because you didn't see the rock that just lodged itself underneath you.  For those just starting out, the suspension can be upgraded immediately upon reaching your first garage along with snagging the larger version of the unique tires. Though their engine upgrades will have to be found in British Columbia, which is a fairly low difficulty DLC map. Once you start getting AWD for other vehicles you may find these vehicles underperform, at which point they can be relegated to highway hauling as stated above or parked as refuel/repair points.  [hr][/hr] [b]TL:DR:[/b]  They're Highway haulers and shallow mud enjoyers and struggle with deep mud and Snow due to lack of AWD. Both capable of 3+4 slot hauling. Suitable for low to mid difficulty maps such as British Columbia. They also look pretty nice as do their unique variants for the Standard and Long Sideboard Bed (TerraPro) and the Log carrier & crane (Pinnacle.) It should also be noted it falls behind other DLC Highway trucks such as the Kenworth W990, which has powerful unique tires unlike these.

3398280,SnowRunner - Mack Dual Pack,188218017,76561198080324704,"TL;DR: Wait for some updates. The Pinnacle is okay, the TerrainPro is a pain. Intelligent driving required for both trucks.  Quite hard to judge those two trucks. The lack of AWD isn't hindering the Mack Pinackle as much as I first thought. With mindful driving and smart usage of the winch, the Pinnacle can go through a lot. Of course it struggles with deep mud and especially with rocky terrain (it slides like crazy!), but I found it quite useful for logging in Austria's second map. The one with the burnt logs, if you wanna know. Logging makes the truck quite top heavy, though. I can see it fulfill a similar role to the Aramatsu Forester with its unique logging crane, minus the good off road capabilities.  I can't be so positive about the TerraPro, unfortunately. While the Pinnacle has lots of torque to get out of some sticky situations, its cousin isn't as lucky. It looks nice (i'm biased towards cab-overs) and it can go through very light mud, on asphalt and many dirt roads, but as soon as you have to go off road, the TerraPro starts to struggle hard. It would probably be better, if it had the same torque as the Pinnacle. I think you can get some use out of it as a mobile workshop and petrol station. (But that would be any other truck as well, wouldn't it?) Maybe as a highway hauler with it's three slot flatbed? I honestly don't know and it will take some time to find the niche for it.  All in all, wait until Saber gives them some love in the next few updates and then decide if it is worth it.",True,1,0,0,,0,29,1739915231

If a RWD-only truck doesn't appeal to you, that's fine!   2) Let's zoom out a bit and take a look at how other games are being monetized these days:  WoT - you can drop $50 on a single vehicle, and they are pumping out new tanks like crazy. Plus the premium tanks nowadays tend to be a bit OP compared to their tech tree counterparts.  WT - same thing: individual high tier vehicles cost as much as an entire AAA game on release-day.  Diablo 4 - purely cosmetic character skins cost upwards of $20. If you want any armor at all that doesn't make you look like a peasant, you have to pay for it with real world money.  And don't get me started on StarCitizen ship prices...  With that in mind (btw I don't buy this stuff for WoT etc), a few dollars for two new trucks - of which one has a unique log loader crane - isn't too bad actually.  3) For me these DLCs are a way of supporting the continued development of SnowRunner.

3398280,SnowRunner - Mack Dual Pack,188122379,76561198144136029,"I'm going to recommend this pack only because of the Mack Pinnacle.  The Mack Terra Pro is simply bad, it looks pretty cool on paper, unique tires, unique 3 slot bed, how ever, it just cannot compete through mud even with it's always on diff-lock & unique tires. The only use I can see for this truck is bringing larger amounts of cargo because of it's 3 sized bed on even ground. Any mud will get this thing struggling, thus you need to winch nearly every-time. The Mack Pinnacle is a truck I genuinely like. I might be a little biased because I love logging & now we finally have a medium logging rack with a crane. That's the big thing with the Pinnacle, it's unique medium logging rack. It can also use a 3 slot sideboard bed too, just like the Terra Pro, which basically makes the Terra Pro useless... oh well... Over-all the Mack Pinnacle does struggle through deep mud, trying to go through some areas on Wisconsin to test it was very embarrassing, it got stuck a lot. I do still like it though & find it quite useful in medium logging. Other than that the Pinnacle isn't too useful. The Terra Pro is basically useless, I'd just sell it.",True,2,0,0,,0,61,1739801250
3398280,SnowRunner - Mack Dual Pack,188112236,76561199084350231,"   I Put Recommended Because I Don't Hate This DLC However I Verry Much Do Have Problems With It.       I have been using both trucks for a minute now and have a pretty good feel for them. (Keep in mind that i am someone that likes quirky trucks, sacrificing one thing for another and filling an obscure niche.) I wanna talk about the custom tires first. The tires do have a slight mud bonus (only a mud rating of 2), however greatly sacrifices off-road traction. Its a shame that we are given custom tires and more often than not they are quite poor in performance, I love unique sets and I wish they were more useful.        The TerraPro does pretty well, Its light, nimble and its diff-lock is always on so its easy to keep from sinking in the mud in most cases. I found it best to use the OHDII tires with this truck, it helps give it good all round traction and weighting the rear axle and the truck is light enough that the extra weight to the front axle doesn't hinder it too much. Its light weigh is great but it can also cause it to become a little tippy if over loaded or with the crane, however its nothing too bad. Obviously deep mud is a problem but thats ture with any truck like this. Overall I like the TerraPro      The Pinnacle struggles alot more than the TerraPro does. The truck feels a lot heavier which it has the power for it, however it seems like all that weight is over the front axle causing it to bind a lot. Its difficult to find a good set of tires for this truck. The unique set has poor off-road traction and the only off-road tires we get with these trucks are the heavy off-road tires, not a problem for the TerraPro but the Pinnacle already has a lot of weight over its dead axle and the OHD tires just add more. The unique addons are really nice and ground isn't as big an issue as you would think it would be, fuel consumption is not bad either and boasts a rather large 93 Gal. fuel tank. The Pinnacle has some really nice up sides despite this fact, its down sides are rather hard to outweigh. I'm torn with this truck, fine sometimes and hair pulling other times.      If you enjoy trucks with up and down sides that require a little bit different thinking then yeah they are nice, I enjoy them for the most part. And if you like trucks you can plow through anything with no glaring flaws then probably skip this one.      Now here is what I want from this pack. Right off the bat, NO I don't think they should have AWD. These truck fill a niche, and small niche but it fills it none the less. Why not lean into it. The TerraPro I think is fine, give it the option of the OHD tires OR the OMD tires for the off-road category. The Pinnacle Has potential, it just lacks rear weight and its wheel base is so long that what weight you add with cargo just seems to add more front weight. So I suggest to make it a Tri-Drive (keeping the dead steer axle), filling a niche that has not been done yet. Having three drive axles in the rear and good fuel economy would help it stand out and still compete. the extra axle would help lift the weight off the front a little bit but providing more traction at the rear and it has the frame space for it. Besides its clear that this truck is meant to be a logging truck and a lot of logging trucks here in America are tri-drives so it would be really fitting. I would also love to see a Mack R series, that is like THE Mack truck to me. I don't think its likely tho.      Its clear that the devs have been pushing for more and more modern American trucks, which modern trucks are nice but I think old trucks are the bread and butter of Snowrunner. I'm worried that using the modern trucks is the only way that the manufactures are willing to give them the rights to use their trucks in the first place. I could be wrong but I think the truck manufactures are to blame for DLC like this not the Devs. And if I am wrong then hey Saber why aren't we seeing a more even spread of old AND new American trucks. The last old american truck we got as a stand alone DLC was the GMC Brigadier and the last 5 American trucks we got were all modern 6x4s. Pretty much Mack R series Please.",True,1,0,0,,0,3,1739787888

For what they are, they are decent. The design is nice to look at, especially the TerraPro brings a pleasant and unique new flavor to the fleet aesthetically.  I predominantly view DLC trucks as collectors' items, and of course there's no task in the game that you couldn't do with the trucks that you can already have in the base game anyway. I wouldn't recommend buying them just because they exist. It's not like you can't play the game without them. I do have to say, I have a lot of things in my fleet that I never really ended up using after trying them once. (Looking at you, Jeeps and Land Rovers...) With that said, I think these MACKs are better than that.  Since they are RWD only at the moment, I'd compare them to the Pacific P512 PF, Ford CLT9000 and the International Transtar 4070A, and of course the Kenworth T880 and Kenworth W990. EDIT: AWD for the Pinnacle has been added later, so the capability has been boosted since my original review (^_^)  The first and most important advantage over most of those is the ability to carry 3 slots of cargo in one trip. Then of course the wheel size options easily put them ahead of the vanilla Ford CLT and the Transtar in terms of capability. The factory included snorkel on the TerraPro makes it a good creek-crosser without spending extra on it. The wide range of addons to choose from, including the rooftop supplies make these trucks very versatile, and the fuel capacity is mostly on par with the Kenworth offerings and the Ford CLT, while all of them are ahead of the Transtar. Both of these MACK trucks will be able to complete a lot of easier tasks on roads and dirt roads, and they can be very useful support vehicles. The Pinnacle is a spare wheel superpower with 4 of them available on the chassis, and the crane + Van Body Addon or crane + Maintenance Frame Addon combo option (that the Kenworth C500 can also use) make it a very capable rescue and repair truck platform. (Also the TerraPro, just like the good old Bandit, can use a Van Body Addon + crane combo.) However, the Pinnacle loses a lot of ground clearance if the lower spare wheels are installed. They are also good for being self propelled fuel stations with repair supplies along frequently used long paths, when you're setting up logistics chains on large maps.  They will probably not become your do-absolutely-everything main trucks, but I can imagine a lot of situations where they will prove useful. They are much better and more capable than the old Ford and Transtar, and decently competing with the Pacific P512 PF, Kenworth T880 and Kenworth W990. After using them for a while in North Carolina, I would definitely recommend putting the raised suspension and the bigger size wheel set on them, along with at least an extended winch, but preferably an advanced winch. I wouldn't recommend them for pulling large semi-trailers. They perform better with flatbeds or sideboard beds and other body addons. I also recommend the off-road gearbox, though depending on the map and task at hand, the stock gearbox can be viable too.  PRO: - Wide selection of addons and rooftop supplies. - Decent wheel sizes. - Capable stock engine. - Very good ground clearance with the raised suspension on the TerraPro.  CON: - No AWD option on the TerraPro will be a dealbreaker in some situations. (Edited after the Pinnacle got AWD.) - Very high in-game truck prices.  SUGGESTION FOR DEVS: - Give the Terra Pro a switchable AWD upgrade option to appeal to a wider market and better justify the price of the DLC. (Edited after the Pinnacle got AWD)  All in all, to summarize, it's more of a collectors' item DLC to support the devs, and less of a capability boost.

The truck doesn’t have super mud performance, but as long as you are driving, this is not a big problem. The real problem starts as soon as you hold still in the mud, even with the special MACK ZES tires.

3398280,SnowRunner - Mack Dual Pack,187757323,76561198019349687,"Short version Review for those not willing to read the rest:  Hold off until they do some tuning (which appears to be coming) or it's on sale. It doesn't have AWD (currently) so if you are gonna leave it in your garage and never use it like your Land Rover Pack... then just don't buy it. DO NOT buy it then proceed to complain that it doesn't have something that you have been told it doesn't have.  Thanks!  If you want more detail, read below:  CONS (the real ones):  PINNACLE: Pinnacle frame length causes some high center issues. I almost never WANT a dead axle added to a vehicle but this one is a candidate that could use one for sure. It also looks really weird with some addon combos where its too long for some things. Pinnacle not having all time difflock hurts it some, it can crawl out of some surprising places in its current form but why one and not the other? Kinda weird nitpicky compliant but just give it all time difflock please. The log crane on the pinnacle is sweet (see more in pros section) but did we really need the little grabber bar that I ALWAYS forget to remove the clamp that ALSO prevents you from using the roofrack? Large Maintenance Frame from the azov7 fits this monstrosity of a frame if you push it back about 3 feet to clear the exhaust, please devs make this happen.  TERRAPRO: Not too much to complain about besides maybe a small nitpick of a slow steering rate which can be overlooked  BOTH: This is a general complaint related to HARD MODE ONLY... but for goodness sake please stop making trucks cost 150k to buy. Normal mode players (probably the majority of the players complaining about no AWD) get this truck for free in their garage. Hard mode if they want this truck they have to budget for 175k or so with upgrades to buy these newer dlc pack trucks... please stop, balance the prices of trucks already! Separately from hard mode, the engines are not available from the start unless you go unlock them in season 10 but it sound like they will be correcting that in the near future so keep an eye on updates.  PROS:  PINNACLE: Log crane is by far the best turn rate and motion of any crane in the game. If we cant have this crane on other vehicles (probably not) please slow down the other log cranes to the same slower turn rate so it doesn't whip logs out like this one does. I love it! Looks are top notch, interior is also sweet. Looks are subjective so YMMV  TERRAPRO: YAY finally a cabover and with OHD1 tires!!! I'm a big fan overall of the look and feel of the truck. Surprisingly capable AND stable when put in off balance situations. Watch your tire spin and you can most of the time crawl out or winch out safely even in 2wd (again possibly not for long). Giving this thing AWD (yes I poked around with modifying the base version) makes this little truck into a beast and I would only state it probably belongs in heavy duty instead of highway if thats the change being made. Really good saddle position, this thing is fantastic as a hauler.  BOTH: The special All Terrain tires are surprisingly good and without doing extra detailed testing I'm wondering if they are more an alternate choice to OHD1 tires than a downgrade or upgrade. Color matching addons are really nice on both, more of this in the future please!  So if you made it this far you might still be interested in buying the pack.   I would say for now if you are a collector, you like a challenge, if Amur is one of your favorite regions, or you like using the transtar in places sometimes, these are pretty fun to play with. I personally am enjoying them and if they do get AWD in the future it will put them closer to the C500 in its current pre-51"" tire state.  If you use the Mastadon in Michigan, if you cant play without modhub that is down right now, if you cry in a corner at the mere sight of snow in the game. Probably don't buy this pack, you wont like it... just wait for modhub to be fixed and download more mods to complete the game and be happy because this is not something you will ever want to take out of your storage.

3398280,SnowRunner - Mack Dual Pack,187742682,76561198152267427,"Updated 3/5/2025: -The Mack Pinnacle now has optional AWD. No idea how they convinced Mack to allow it since neither them nor Mack Defense offer it and I haven't yet seen evidence of aftermarket conversions. At least the AWD upgrade actually has a transfer case and front axle this time, unlike the Wolf Pack DLC.  -They fixed the Mack Pinnacle not being able to tow a trailer with a crane and bed installed. Now you can.  -They fixed the issue of the engine upgrades being locked behind Season 10. They still use the Mack Defense engines, but now its a copy with less fuel consumption and are unlocked by default.   -When they were fixing the crane+bed+trailer combo on the Pinnacle, they also removed the trailer offset when the logging crane is installed. This means that trailers no longer attach to the crane's trailer hitch and will stay attached to the truck's hitch. Thankfully, the crane's collision box in the hitch area is cut down, so it doesn't get in the way of trailer articulation unless the trailer starts hitting the crane's outriggers. There is clipping though, so the offset should be restored.  -They added a trailer block when the 3 slot sideboard is installed, intentionally as per the patch notes. They didn't do the same thing with the 3 slot flatbed. Weird change since there are worse trucks to tow trailers with a sideboard, like the Bandit with a crane and bed.  -They added the JAT medium mud tires to both trucks. These generally don't perform as well as OHD I tires and are lighter than the other tires these trucks get, which means the suspensions will be much weaker. So, putting any weight with these tires equipped will bottom out your suspension.  -Review was changed to Recommended since the AWD upgrade for the Pinnacle, while not what I feel was needed, is still an improvement at least.   [strike]First, there are 2 significant bugs with these trucks. I will update this review should anything change.  -Despite both trucks having unique engines in the game files, they are actually using the Mack Defense engines. If you do not have Season 10 and are not running NG+ with all upgrades unlocked, or have it and haven't found the upgrades, you WILL NOT be able to upgrade the engines.  -The Mack Pinnacle cannot do the crane+bed+trailer combo, despite having ample space to attach a trailer. [/strike]  I will preface my review by saying that yes, you CAN do basically everything in this game with these trucks. The same goes for almost every other truck in this game. BUT, just because you can, that doesn't always mean it's fun. Being RWD means you have to constantly watch your wheel speed cause it is very easy to dig yourself into the mud. So with these trucks, you are going to be going everywhere in low gear. Even in lighter terrain, if you start spinning your wheels, they'll dig down into mud. You need to be in low gear before you get stuck, not after because you simply cannot dig yourself out without a winch or another truck.   Pros: -Both trucks have great models, sounds, and custom addons. Especially the Pinnacle's logging addons.  -Both trucks are very versatile with a ton of addon choice. -Both trucks get roof racks with above average repair and their spare tire addons come with 2 instead of 1. -The TerraPro has the perfect amount of frame space to do the crane+bed+trailer combo without the bed hanging past the rear of the frame.  -The Pinnacle has an extended frame to support medium logs without getting in the way of a trailer (there are very few trucks that are like this). [strike]-The Mack Defense engines are actually a better choice than their unique engines because its gives a buff to the TerraPro and a much needed nerf to the Pinnacle (its unique engines have the most torque in the game by a longshot and would be incredibly easy to dig yourself to China with that much power). [/strike] -The unique tires seem to be SLIGHTLY better than even OHD 1 and look like the way to go to get the best performance out of these trucks.  -The Pinnacle has optional AWD and performs well with it.   Cons: -[strike]Both trucks are[/strike] The Terra Pro is RWD only -The tires are no where near as good as those on the Pacifics to compensate for being RWD only. The standard tires in this game are balanced with AWD in mind. That is why the Pacifics get such good tires, because they are RWD only but are meant to still be good trucks. Without Pacific levels of grip, these trucks fall behind nearly every other truck in the game.  -The Pinnacle's extended frame while only being a tandem axle is going to lead to it getting high-centered more often. Its collision box is fairly forgiving, but the issue still comes up.   Changes I would make: -Pacific tires for the Pinnacle. (without AWD) -AWD for the TerraPro. Military and aftermarket AWD conversions exist for this truck and this game lacks any 6x6 cabover trucks.  [strike]-Should the trucks be changed to use their unique engines, change them to Mack Defense torque values as that is plenty of power for these trucks. [/strike] Fixed -Ideally, I know this isn't likely at this point, they should've added another axle to the Pinnacle to make into a tri-drive. A tri-drive with duallies would be a unique addition to the game, since we have so many tandem axle trucks. Its a common chassis in logging trucks, would give it more traction and may even make the Pacific tires unnecessary, and would alleviate some of the high-centering issues.  [strike]Just for context, this review was written by someone whose most driven truck is the Freightliner 114SD. That truck performed better than the Pinnacle at medium logging, despite having no room for the trailer to pitch up. I'm not expecting these to be OP, just enjoyable to use like the GMC.

3398280,SnowRunner - Mack Dual Pack,187738584,76561198012297440,"[b]You need to know how to effectively use RWD (rear wheel drive) trucks offroad, or have an interest in learning how to use them. This proficiency pre-requirement isn't optional. If you don't care about this and/or you don't know why it is important to understand how to balance your cargo mass on RWD trucks, or why tire options are even more important for these trucks, don't buy this DLC.[/b]  Those who are well-acquainted with RWD trucks are going to get some very enticing and useful features with this package, many of which will be particularly handy for hard mode (like the gearboxes and the special crane for the Pinnacle). I'll start by describing what both trucks have in common, and then I'll move onto specific details for each model. Keep in mind that while one should always expect rear wheel drive trucks to underperform when not loaded, the performance hit is nowhere as significant as for the recently released Kenworth T880.  Both trucks come stock with [b]Multipurpose gearboxes[/b]. Functionally-speaking, these gearboxes are akin to Highway gearboxes in that they have a Low and High Gear, and that they both have 8 Automatic gears. Where they differ is that the Multipurpose one provides higher fuel efficiency in Automatic than the Highway gearbox, moderately lower speed to the high gear (compared to a Highway gearbox), and can seemingly engage high gear under higher rolling resistance/lower momentum conditions. Multipurpose also seems to provide more torque in higher automatic gears. In my tests, I found that  the Highway gearbox burnt marginally more fuel but provided savings through means of higher speed; the more aggressive the terrain, the more you will benefit from using the Multipurpose gearbox and the more fuel it'll save.  The stock [b]unique all-terrain tires[/b] for both trucks seem to feature additional softness, but this is compensated with a very thin profile that allows them to cut through soft surfaces and maximize pressure per unit of tire surface area (and thus traction). I tested these tires while pulling double medium logs with both trucks while doing a loop in the first map in Alaska, driving left from the garage and then right at the offroad junction towards the gas station, then collecting logs and heading uphill past the water crossing towards the factories until completing a full loop moving east, then south to the garage. This path leads through one ugly mud pit, then water wading, then several snow pits combined with slopes, and some muddy water crossings. The all-terrains did it all, and I never had to use the winch. I actually found that the performance seemed to deteriorate when testing with OHD 3 tires, but further tests are necessary to validate this. Both trucks also offer [b]options for Highway, OHD and chained tires[/b], but I recommend you keep the unique all-terrain ones. [b]The unique all-terrains also seem to slip less on ice than other non-chained options.[/b]  Another interesting trait for both trucks is that they both come with [b]enhanced suspensions[/b], and that they also have a more [b]flexible frame[/b] than most; these features help them achieve better traction and stability.  I should also point out that both trucks come with a [b]cargo rack for fuel and parts[/b], and that both can carry dual mounts of [b]spare tires[/b] either behind the cab, or on the chassis (or both). Furthermore, the [b]stock engines are adequate for very heavy loads[/b], and upgrades (the same engines that the Mack Defense uses) are unnecessary but available. It's also possible to install [b]3-slot cargo beds[/b] on both trucks (but not alongside light cranes). Both trucks can pull [b]double loads of medium logs[/b], and the TerraPro can be coupled to trailers while having a standard-size cargo bed and light crane installed. The [b]Futom log trailer is incompatible[/b] for both trucks.   The [b]Mack Pinnacle[/b] is a Heavy-Duty class truck with an extra-long chassis, RWD and selectable differential locks. The selectable locks are quite handy for a chassis so long since it prevents the truck from losing traction when turning on solid surfaces at higher speeds. The most noticeable trait of the Pinnacle is that it provides incredibly good balance and sway control, remaining extremely stable in a consistent manner, while moving very high mass top heavy loads, even when fitted with a raised suspension and 46 inch tires (biggest possible). It appeared even more stable than various trucks with pusher axles.  Perhaps strangely, the Pinnacle (unlike the TerraPro) cannot fit a light crane + standard size bed + trailer combo, despite having the right chassis length for it, and yet it can fit an extended bed + trailer combo; it is possible this may be a bug.   Another unique trait of the Pinnacle is the option for a rear-mounted logging crane. This makes it convenient for loading logs on the truck and on a coupled trailer without a need to detach said trailer. The crane appears to be slightly more stable and precise than the generic red crane that can be mounted on most trucks, and apparently provides slightly better control over the logs.  The [b]Mack TerraPro[/b] is a Highway-class truck with rear wheel drive and always-on differential locks. This one features a shorter frame and an option for slightly larger tires (47 inch), as well as always-on differential locks. It also features a unique cargo bed; the 2-slot version has a built-in spare tire mount, whereas the 3-slot version provides no extra fetures aside from the increased capacity.  This truck has a harder time dealing with heavier loads since it lacks the higher mass of the Pinnacle, and tends to exhibit more lateral sway. Nevertheless, it remains quite capable, and the combination of shorter frame with larger wheels enables it to better deal with such terrain types where greater chassis length can be detrimental.   This truck can mount a crane, cargo bed, and also be coupled to a trailer. While it can pull a logs trailer while carrying a second load on the frame, I do not recommend this particular use for this truck when going uphill since the trailer can collide with the rear of the truck; should one encounter this issue, the fix is to detach the trailer and winch it the necessary distance for it to be coupled when both trailer and truck are leveled.",True,81,6,0,,0,13,1739323782

When I was exploring the details and deciding to try it or not, I was compelled by the genre and the artwork. What was not clear was that this was developed in French, and while this would typically not be an issue, the detail is important for why I was super frustrated after attempting to play for around 20m.  The reason is that the game is oriented to non-English keyboards, definitely not set for a standard QWERTY, and has no ability to reset the keybindings. I have played European games with this issue before, but they always have had the ability to set at least the basic movement commands, presumably under the assumption that players may need to do exactly that... But this game only offers one ""option"" and it's to change the video quality... a choice I find strange because the game is listed with minimum requirements that are kinda high, minimums that should easily handle the relative simplicity of the environment and the interactions. I guess it should be said though that the minimum requirements as listed are not accurate because, for example, the ""minimum"" required OS is listed as Windows 11 and that certainly wasn't a stopping point for me. I suspect that the minimum and the recommended tech lists are incorrectly entered, considering the recommended tech listed in the store is simply a 64-bit system.  But the keybindings are awful on an English QWERTY. Want to go forward? You have to figure out just which movement key is accurate because we are NOT working with ASWD standards. The forward key is actually Z. Going left? that's Q. The keys A and W do not have any function... but of course, in this day and age, we expect appropriate localization for the regions the game is released in, or at least having the option to adjust the details for your typical regional setups. AWSD movement keys are a long-standing gaming standard for movement... and yet, you either have to re-orient your keyboard use in a way that doesn't make sense (it is actually fairly difficult, at least for me, to simply swap my ""forward"" key to one that feel oriented for backward, and likewise trying to go left but having to use a key oriented to forward). It wouldn't have been so bad if they had at least TOLD us that this was the case... But I found myself attempting to adjust to using the arrow keys instead, because those worked correctly for the directions.  Somehow I still managed to complete a ritual or fill in the first circle of the final ritual... I have zero idea if I did things correctly or what I'm supposed to do going forward in the game. I looked at many objects and the game says you're looking for clues to perform these actions, but there's no guide, no instructions, and the journal you're carrying gives a prompt for ""the ritual"" but only references one of the emotions... Perhaps the idea is that by engaging with the place, you find enough information to figure out which emotions you should emulate, but performing the ritual was also not  exactly intuitive either.  It honestly feels like there are a lot of gaps and a lack of thought put into making sure it is set up for the regions. Localization and language translations are really important for the player to feel capable and invested. I don't want to have to troubleshoot things to figure out how to play the game; even a simply keymapping info list without adjustment options would be great... But I don't want to say that this is the only issue, because it is not. I would be willing to try again if more time was invested into localization and optimization. As it stands, I don't think I can reasonably engage with the mechanics enough to even build confidence organically.   Good luck to the developers as you consider and potentially work on adjusting the content to be more flexible and informative for the player. Good luck to fellow players, I hope that if you give it a try, my pointing out the keybinding disconnect can save you the several minutes it took me to suss it out.

Interestingly, the achievements are unrelated to tomatoes; instead, players are tasked with finding distinctive items like a flamingo or a pumpkin.  As a fan of the first installment, I hoped for a similar experience, but many sequels tend to overcomplicate things by introducing an excessive number of new characters alongside beloved ones, making the narrative feel somewhat forced.

Some tomatoes are cleverly concealed, but those behind windows, which have a pronounced blue tint, can be particularly elusive.

There are achievements for finding the particular one-off items (sometimes identical to many others e.g. roof aerials) but not for locating tomatoes.

3397510,Hidden Tomatoes 2,186018170,76561197961539340,"Y'know, there're quite a few things not to like about this game. The overly restrictive zoom setting, for one. The 3D environment being used to place tomatoes where you need to be at the right angle to see them (including inside buildings and vehicles), but without a way to rotate the camera for another. The ""hint"" system that either does not exist, or in the current version simply does not work. All pretty bad.  But the thing that really gets me is the side tasks. As well as looking for tomatoes, you're asked to find a number of other objects. A flamingo. A pumpkin. An antenna. That in itself is totally fine, usually a bonus for a find-the-object game. But in this game, inexplicably, there are multiple of all of these objects... but only one counts.  Oh, you're looking for a flamingo? You found a flamingo? You clicked on the flamingo? Sorry, nothing for you; it wants that [i]other[/i] flamingo. And one of the other antennas. And one of the other pumpkins. (Also, ""fun"" tip; once you find one of the objects it wants, you can keep clicking the empty space and the game will keep playing a noise and showering confetti like you found it for the first time, as much as you want. I guess they didn't consider removing the trigger.)  Nope, not a fan. Fix the hint system, make the collectable side objects distinctive, and this might be passable. As it is, there are plenty of free hidden object games on Steam, and I'd advise trying out some of the others. This isn't the worst I've played, by a long shot, but there's definitely far better out there.  If you really, really must (and, trust me, don't), then one more bit of advice; turn the graphics settings to minimum. The glass is overly cloudy with the graphics up; there were quite a few tomatoes I missed despite looking in exactly the right place just because I couldn't see them through the glass. Set it down, the glass is actually transparent (y'know, like [i]glass[/i]), and it becomes a lot fairer.  Edit: Oh, also, one more thing. I've now given the first in the series a go, and... are these games on the same map? Do they not let you turn the camera round because, if you did, you'd immediately realise it's the same damned level, just with the tomatoes re-placed and a few scenery items moved around?

You cannot rotate the map, only pan around it using your mouse. One thing I wished this game had was interactive elements. It would have made the game stand out so much more. Like being able to open doors, garages, car trunks and windows. For some tomatoes and items you will need to pan the camera back and forth to see items hidden behind things that are obstructed if viewed head on.   I will be honest, I was not a fan of the music. It is music that reminds me of a clown act. The funny, wonky music that you hear when a clown is performing a bunch of funny acts on stage. So I ended up muting the game and putting on my own tunes while playing.  Overall not a bad game and the price is nice (free). It just needs some interactive elements to make it more lively and maybe a different choice in music. Some tomatoes are hard to find however so it does have some challenge to it which is nice. 🍅   [quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32732116-IndieGems/] Follow [b]IndieGems[/b] [/url] for more reviews like this one.

3397510,Hidden Tomatoes 2,185861423,76561198343807112,"You are... Someone with a lot of time on your hands trying to find 100 tomatoes that are scattered throughout a suburban environment in [b]HIDDEN TOMATOES 2[/b], a hidden object game by [b]PARHAM[/b].   There is a saying that if you only play games in your preferred genres that you will eventually end up not having anything to play at all. Game developers, as every industry does, caters to the audience at large and the gaming preferences of that audience shifts over time even when your own preferences may not. Even amongst genres that you may prefer, such as first-person shooters, for example, gameplay mechanics evolve over time such that the first-person shooters that you played when you were younger are now drastically different than the ones preferred by most players now.  Therefore, it's always nice to play a game outside of my comfort zone.  HIDDEN TOMATOES 2 is the sequel to HIDDEN TOMATOES, a series of games that would be classified as ""hidden object"" games. In these games, you must carefully examine an environment to find one particular object or, in this case, a particular type of object (red tomatoes, to be exact).  I'll admit up front that I'm not really drawn towards the ""casual gaming"" genres, of which the ""hidden object"" genre is one of them. I grew up with first-person shooters, role-playing games, turn-based & real-time strategy, side-scrolling adventure games and all of the other main staples of gaming from the 1980s through the early 2000s. That doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the work and effort that goes into creating these types of games. However, sometimes having a fresh perspective is good for both the gamer and the developer.  In HIDDEN TOMATOES 2, you are tasked with finding 100 red tomatoes that have been 'hidden' in a suburban environment. The area is relatively vast, encompassing the properties of about a half-dozen houses and a few stores, along with their interconnecting road system.  You play from a first-person perspective but you aren't so much as walking around in the environment but hovering about, almost like a flying drone. You can zoom in on a particular area but your field-of-view is always locked looking forward; For whatever reason, you can't look side-to-side or behind you. The environment that you are in is polygon-based and so are the objects that you are looking for. This arrangement of limitations causes some of these tomatoes to be ""behind"" other objects due to your limited field-of-view, meaning that you'll need to be crafty in order to spot them. You'll need a combination of camera position and magnification if you want to spot all 100 of the tomatoes.  The graphical presentation of the game is visually appealing. As I wrote before, it's polygon-based with solid-color textures, evoking a visual style that I last saw in another game called ""Saloon King."" It's not meant to be realistic visually but the area that you search is certainly representative of an actual suburban area. There are houses with gardens, mailboxes and vehicles. A gas station and convenience store are competently portrayed. Barring the cartoonish styling of the graphics, it would resemble a typical suburban area.  There is music and sound effects for the game. Although I tend to prefer to play games without music simply to concentrate on the gameplay, I turned the music on in order to gauge how it fit into the game. The music could best be described as whimsical and something befitting of a circus carnival. It's cute but doesn't quite fit the game. It sounds like the type of music you would listen to when someone is juggling at a fair or walking through the carnival games section at a fair. The sound effect of finding a tomato was perfectly fine.  If you get stuck with trying to find a particular tomato, there is a hint system. Clicking on the tomato icon reveals a weather vane that literally points you in the correct direction of a hidden tomato. Simply follow the weather vane arrow (it will change as you progress towards the tomato) until you find the tomato.  Although the game is inoffensive, that doesn't mean that the game is not without its flaws.  For starters, I don't know why the camera position is so restrictive. It may be because of developer skill or it may be because of gameplay. However, a polygon-based environment such as this one almost begs for the game to give you full 360-degree turning. It's understandable that the game contains invisible walls, restricting your ability to move outside of a given area but the inability to simply turn your view was very frustrating. I understand that some of the tomatoes needed a very specific camera position and magnification in order to find and that could have been a part of the gameplay. However, I think that it would have been more entertaining to have had the ability to see the environment from different angles as well.  Also, the game doesn't really tell you how to access the hint system (for the record, I decided to call it quits after finding ninety-two of the tomatoes the old-fashioned way). And the game didn't exactly indicate anywhere that your progress is saved if you end a session; That would be helpful given that the people who tend to gravitate towards these types of games tend to have busy lives that are constantly interrupted for one reason or another. Having text pop up somewhere saying that your progress is saved if you decide to quit would be helpful.  I was a little surprised that there was no achievement in Steam for finding all 100 tomatoes without using the hint system. Or, for that matter, finding 80 tomatoes in that matter (or any number). Yet there were achievements for finding other objects, such as an American football or an antenna. It would have been helpful if, in the game, you had some idea that clicking onto these items would cause you to fulfill an achievement.  Finally, the game doesn't have any sort of story with it. Granted, if your game is fun enough... You don't really need one! The first Quake game had a story that could be written on the back of a blank business card and a lot of the old arcade games didn't need any stories at all. However, having a compelling story can compensate when a gamer isn't very compelled to either start playing your game or continue to play your game. As someone who doesn't play ""hidden object"" games, the game stopped being fun once I had made two sweeps of the entire area looking for tomatoes and not finding all of them. Having some sort of story might have made me search harder.  [b]Overall, I'm mildly recommending this game.[/b] It's free, it's visually appealing and the gameplay is mostly non-offensive. I could see this game being something that you place in front of kids in order to entertain them for awhile. Veteran gamers won't be put off by the lack of documentation but senior citizens and people who aren't into gaming may need more explanation about some of the functions; When in doubt, explain. Some of the tomatoes require a real quirky combination of magnification and camera position in order to locate but most of them can be found without needing to be an expert in hidden object games. The music is cute but doesn't really fit with the game. Granted, I'm not sure what genre of music is most appropriate for finding tomatoes in a suburban environment but I'll leave that up to the developer to figure out.  In the end, I really want the developer to explore the possibility of giving the player 360-degrees of control with the camera; I think that would be a swell feature for future games in the series and really open up the possibilities when it comes to hiding tomatoes (or anything else).  I'm not a ""hidden object"" gamer but this game did not dissuade me from being one.

It utilizes AI-generated images set against simple backgrounds, which can lead to a somewhat distracting experience for players. The music, typical of clicker games, serves its purpose without being particularly memorable or bothersome.

I'm rooting for the fact that I can play a bit more soon. I adore that we can purchase little shops and perfect the recipes based on customer feedback. However, what I love even more is that we can give the kittens a gentle rub to motivate them to work. But fear not! You can set up automatic rubs when you have several shops to help you get through it. When you meet all the goals, your level finishes, and you can move on to the next one. Or, if you wish, you can stay at your current one. It's simple in design and gameplay yet so effective, and the low-fi beats in the background make me feel relaxed and at ease.   I already took a sneak peek into the second level, and things are getting mixed up a little bit. This makes me super curious about every level beyond that to see what else is in store for us. If an occasional change happens or something gets added, it’ll stop it from being bland or boring, so that’s nice. But time will tell since I’m not that far in yet. If needed, I’ll come and update my review. But I already wanted to do a quick one to show my support and love for this little gem of a game and developer(s) since it can help them and get a reach. This is super important for the little indies out there!  I provided the developer with some feedback suggesting the addition of a meow sound slider. Yes, it is adorable that the cats meow when you pat their heads. However, it becomes rather tedious after a few minutes, so it might be worth considering the option to tone it down or disable it in the future. Besides that, I haven’t found any flaws yet.  There are five levels now, so it may be short, depending on the goals and how fast you complete those.

It's a mobile game, best way to describe it. Egregiously bad gameplay, controls, graphics, missions and sound design (all four guns sound the same, there's a ""civilian_scream.mp3 every time a level finishes). There's only like 10 main and 10 side ""missions"", basically all of them are ""shoot this guy or these guys"" which wouldn't be an issue if they did anything different with some of them, there's only one unique mission where there's a hostage in the way, there's no more creativity after that. The side missions are necessary to grind, there's no randomisation for better replayability, so you'll be shooting the same guys over and over again, and their payout is ridiculously low, so you'll have to grind a lot. Upgrading a weapon is necessary to buy a new one, and buying new ones is necessary to play new story missions, which are no different from side missions, except you can only play them once (which is better, since it would become even more of a grindfest). And after buying the last gun, there's no reason to collect money anyway, cause there are no other items or anything else you can buy, but the main mission payouts after that rifle are huge for some reason. This whole shebang makes even those 30 minutes it takes to beat the entire game feel like several hours. I beat it out of spite.

Game has extremely poor collision physics, even a slight bump against the wall often causes the car to suddenly stop. Tracks are quite repetitive as they are mainly variations of the same 2 (or maybe 3) maps.   Career is short and only takes about an hour and a half to finish. Last race glitches out at the finish line, your car just stops and nothing happens, no result screen or any indication that the race has finished, car just sits there and controls stop responding.   One of the (very few) positives is a decent choice of cars, albeit unlicensed and without any options to modify them except for increasing max speed.  If the horrible collision physics were fixed along with adding at least some visual car customisation options and perhaps an option to add your music or online radio stream in-game then it would be a decent-ish cheap game.

You’ll have to pay for this in eight days, and at this stage, I’m not sure it’s worth even your Energon credits.  [b]Where to start?[/b] Let’s begin with the lack of guidance. When I, Starscream, booted up this game, I expected a glorious introduction fit for a Decepticon warlord. Instead, I was thrown into chaos with no tutorial, no instructions, and no sense of purpose. It’s as if the developers assumed mere mortals would figure things out on their own - an oversight of cosmic proportions.  Then there’s the [b]options menu,[/b] or rather, the lack thereof. A proper ruler demands customization! Where are the graphics settings? Must Starscream endure this subpar presentation without the ability to adjust resolution or effects? All I’m given is volume control. [i]Volume control?[/i] Do you think I play games for the sound of my own superiority? (Well, sometimes.)  The [b]drifting mechanic,[/b] oh, what a disappointment. Drifting should feel like commanding a sleek Cybertronian scout through battle maneuvers - precise, exhilarating, and visually stunning. Instead, it’s clunky and unresponsive, with no skid lines, no visual feedback, and no joy. It’s like piloting a junker through molasses.  [b]And now, the second level...[/b] If I thought things couldn’t get worse, I was wrong. The game’s presentation and execution feel so rudimentary that it draws an unwelcome comparison to a [i]PlayStation Net Yaroze[/i] project. For the uninitiated, those were amateur, barebones creations made on Sony’s DIY development kit in the late '90s. To be blunt: it’s [i]that[/i] bad. It’s as though this game belongs in a museum of gaming mediocrity rather than the Steam storefront.  [b]Context matters![/b] Just last week, Tokyo Xtreme Racer roared onto Steam after an 18-year hiatus. That game, with its legacy and polish, sets a high bar for the street-racing genre. Urban Shadows Racing™ Tokyo, by comparison, doesn’t just fall short - it’s like racing a tricycle against a jet. It’s painfully obvious where the competition stands, and sadly, it’s not in favor of this game.  [b]But I am not entirely unkind.[/b] The neon-lit streets of Tokyo hint at potential. The atmosphere is there, and the music is well-chosen, lending a touch of energy to an otherwise lifeless experience. If the developers continue to polish this game, it might evolve into something worthy of my praise - though that day is not today.  [b][i]Verdict:[/i][/b] As a Steam Curator, my time is valuable, and my judgment is final. This game is an ambitious project that, for now, feels unfinished. Developers, take heed: you’ve been granted the attention of Starscream - use it wisely!  [b]3.7/10. Music earns it points. Everything else? Back to the assembly line, mortals.[/b]",False,4,0,55,55,0,218,1738658979

The exploration-based gameplay and the mysterious plot are intriguing, while the artstyle and the sound design create a compelling atmosphere.

I appreciated how you are given complete freedom to explore from the beginning, you can wander through the many many rooms as you wish and can solve the puzzles in any order.  There is a permadeath element (though it's not present in the easy mode), as you have to restart if the monster catches you, but it's not as oppressing as other stalker enemies in most horror games, since most of the time you'll be able to see the monster when you enter a room and just find another route.  Even if it sees you and you can't find a hiding place, there's a ""last chance"" system where you and it throw a dice and if you win you can continue escaping. Exploration (and memorizing the mansion layout) is important because you can find several items that give you a permanent boost to speed, stamina and to the luck you need for the dice throwing.

This is a bad idea implemented badly, so it's no wonder it was a complete flop.   As mentioned, this features really godawful, ""wrong"" looking AI slop instead of genuinely and sincerely created game assets.  It's hard to say if this was because the developer didn't have the skill to do the job of creating real game assets or couldn't afford to hire someone who does, but it also doesn't matter.  What matters is that this looks bad because of that decision.  AI slop sticks out like a sore thumb... and it comes across as insulting.  Worse, it's hard to tell how much of this is AI slop and how much of it came from the developer pretending to be an artist with MS-Paint.  There's also the old adage that those who lack the budget and talent to make their own game assets usually lack the budget and talent to do the rest of the job of game development properly, too, and that's glaringly obvious here.  This is ""free"" enough, at least you won't be expected to spend any more money after you download this, but just because something is free doesn't mean it's good.

I get that it's all a part of the aesthetic the game is trying to pull off but it gets really annoying and it's hard to hear some of the words Kewter says. Second, words will flash up on screen and you will have no time to read them.

The first is the poor sound quality of many of the speech sections even when the speaker is meant to be rational (perhaps this is part of the parody of an influencer's home-made fashion show?). The second is the deliberate randomness of two of the achievements (the developer wrote in a discussion that the appearance or otherwise of these is randomly determined at the start of a new game); I was lucky enough to get both by the end of my second playthrough but I wouldn't have tried a third time.

3395410,Cats of Mona Lisa - A hidden object game,185231311,76561198128704797,"[b]Note:[/b] An awesome friend gifted me a copy of this game. ^^  [h1]Like being at an art museum (sort of). XD[/h1]  [h2]Introduction[/h2]  [i]Cats of Mona Lisa - A hidden object game[/i] is a cat-themed, hidden object game developed and published by Petite Games.  It has a brief story intro, which is basically that some mischievous cats have found themselves in classic beautiful paintings created by legendary artists and it's up to you find them all. XD  As for the gameplay, there are 6 paintings each from 8 legendary artists, such as Van Gogh and Monet.  In each painting, 10 cats are hidden, and there are the usual functions, like the zoom and hint ones.  However, only full screen mode is available, and no Steam achievements or trading cards are present at the time of this review.  Still, there's a classical soundtrack as well as cute meowing sound effects when you find and click on a cat.  In addition, the game won't count towards a user's global total until it's out of ""Steam is learning about this game"".  [h2]Review[/h2]  Having played quite a lot of these cat-themed HOGs, I found [i]Cats of Mona Lisa[/i] to be an interesting twist.  (Funnily enough, though, the painting of Mona Lisa never makes an appearance in the game.)  I like that there's a bit of a story behind the cats being in these paintings, but for the curious cat in me (no pun intended lol), I would have liked to read a bit of backstory on how the cats end up trapped in these paintings or what happens to them after you find them all.  However, the game provides some interesting history about the various artists, ranging from the 18th to 20th centuries, which I found to be fascinating.  Still, it's the gameplay that's of main interest.  First, I wish that there had been the option to choose between full screen or windowed mode since I tend to prefer the latter.  Regardless, finding the cats was quite doable.  Even though they can be a bit difficult to find at times (since some of them blend really well with the paintings), I was able to find them all quickly.  It helps to have both the zoom and hint functions available although only 3 hints are provided per painting.  Of course, I wish that Steam achievements were available, especially since they tend to be par for the course for these types of HOGs.  This doesn't bother me too much since I like to enjoy games and I think that achievements are a nice bonus (but unnecessary).  I can understand if some might be disappointed by their absence.  As for the art, it goes without saying that it's beautiful.  The paintings are classics, and looking at them reminds me of fond memories of when I'd visit various art museums with my dad.  Even though I'm a terrible artist (I think that writing is my better strength ^^), I appreciate wonderful works of art that have been carefully crafted by people of exceptional talent.  Well, I wish I could have taken screenshots of these paintings, but apparently, that function is disabled, so you'll have to rely on screenshots from the game's Steam store page.  With the music, the tracks are truly lovely and relaxing to listen to.  They're all from the classical or Romanticism periods, so you can listen to timeless works by Vivaldi and Mozart.  These tracks are perfect for playing the levels and finding all those cute kitties, and they really give off that air of being in a classy art museum.  [h2]Conclusion[/h2]  Overall, would I recommend [i]Cats of Mona Lisa - A hidden object game[/i]?  If you enjoy hidden object games, especially cat-themed ones, have an appreciation for classical works, and/or don't mind the lack of Steam achievements, then I think this is worth taking a look.  Granted, it is on the short side, as it took me around 30 minutes to complete all of the levels.  For the asking price, it might be a bit pricey if you're adept at finding hidden object items quickly, so I'd recommend waiting for a good sale.  Still, I had fun, and it was worth spending a bit of time to try it out. ^^  [quote]For more detailed, fully complete, high quality reviews like this, please follow [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/44702020/]The Introverted Gamer[/url], prioritizing heart and soul always. ^^[/quote]",True,11,1,29,29,0,326,1736485493

And during the bossfight I also couldn't figure out the direction they were gonna move me to until I jump in them and get stuck to the ground most of the time, resulting in dying from the boss. - I feel like it would be nice if there would be a stronger indicator of when you're gonna die when you stop moving - Also the 2nd level(i think? or the 3rd) feels way harder than the next one - I've also ran into some softlocks when portals were not opened anymore - also the hitbox of the player feels a bit weird to me but that might be a skill issue I guess lol  And that's about it I think. On the other hand, the game runs very very smoothly, there is a good feeling of speed with the effects in game.

3394910,The Gate Of The Moon,188735323,76561198003013967,"Game’s mechanics revolve around a unique take on level manipulation. Instead of controlling just your character, you also have control over the very structure of the stage itself. With the press of a button, the screen zooms out, revealing a grid-like layout where each room—identical in size—can be shifted around.   However, there’s a catch: rooms can only be moved into adjacent empty space, meaning you can’t simply place them wherever you please. This spatial constraint forms the backbone of the game’s 30 mind-bending levels, where the goal remains the same—grab the key and reach the portal.  Adding another layer of complexity is the requirement for room exits to align perfectly. If even a single terrain block is out of place, the border remains sealed, blocking movement. This becomes especially tricky when special destructible blocks come into play.  These blocks serve as both a tool and a hazard; they can be walked on and shattered to open up pathways, but once they’re gone, they’re gone for good.   Destroying the wrong block can render a stage unsolvable, often forcing players to jump into a deadly trap to reset the stage. Fortunately, there are checkpoints that fix some of the tricky situations.  Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper puzzle-platformer without an array of classic hazards. Spikes, rotating axes, and other deathtraps stand between you and victory, with each stage gradually introducing new elements and expanding the number of rooms you must juggle.   While the visual design remains fairly consistent throughout, one particular hazard, the retractable spikes, can be frustrating. Since you can’t look at room below, you often have to jump blind and hope you got the timing right.",True,3,0,26,26,0,1798,1740499137

When it starts to get challenging it mostly comes from the platforming, not the puzzles. Nonetheless the puzzles definitely add enjoyment and variety to the game and the whole package is very pleasant. Like most precision platformers there are frequent checkpoints, so even when you might die a lot, you don’t have to repeat a whole lot of the stage in order to get back.   I did wish for controller support, however with Steam Input it was possible to roll my own that worked as well as native support would have, I suspect.

Freud would call this work a piece of art, a work that could ease people’s lives, as it can be used to escape from reality. It’s a distraction from whatever current mood you might be in, whether it’s anger or sadness, a great work that could be classified as escapism.  In Belgium, we have a comedian called Philippe. Because of the humor found in making associations, this game would be called by him “Baldur’s Gate 3 from the Aldi.” Aldi is a shop in Belgium known not for being cheap, but for its offering affordable items.  Now, the perspective we’ve least been waiting for... my own. I enjoyed playing the game, maybe due to following the developers through their media (like YouTube), or maybe because I just needed to get lost in a piece of distraction that pulls me into a whimsical world of fantasy and comedy. It’s a medium that was fast to download, quick to get into, and at least for now, affordable (it’s free, so just try it!).",True,1,0,29,29,0,1,1737914517

Best boy is also cute-best boy and hero-best boy too.  Don't tell my cat about this though!  Doggings is an adorable bite-sized point and click adventure packed with cute and funny moments featuring best boy Doggins.   The game is very short, thus the bite-size tag, taking around 15 to 20 minutes to complete. The puzzles aren't very challenging but are mostly about figuring out how to use (and combine) the items you've collected thus far to progress the story.   I got stuck in one part because of my screen's brightness. It was too bright. I don't like looking up what to do but unfortunately, I had to. That’s when I noticed I was ""missing"" part of the image on screen. I switched my setting a bit and voila. It's been a dark few days, so I had to up the brightness. I had no idea it was so bright it would hide some light grey lines 🤣  Besides that, it was a very easy going and fun game. On top of being cute, having adorable minimalistic art, and beautiful 40's-50's retro music (although YT went - no no no!- on one of the tracks).  I won't delve into the story because it's so short, I'd ruin the whole thing. Just know, best boy is on the moon! An adorable best boy on the moon!? That's all you need to know really.

3394510,A Short Death,189566887,76561197995669628,"It kinda feels like a bad Playstation 1 game, but I don't mean it in a negative way, it feels intentional, and once you get the timing it's very accurate actually, just takes a few minutes to get that muscle memory. As you progress you will get the ability to transform between 4 characters, each having some movement gimmick, and you can also use them in some shortcuts if you accidentally find yourself roaming. The narrative was a little silly but it made me laugh a few times, I like the overall homebrew feel of the game, and I thought the ending felt very heartwarming.  Generally I don't care for these games, you know the 'GO UP' platformers, frankly I just find them very generic, but this game had a little bit of charm to it with various character mechanics, and it does not really focus that much on the difficulty, it's actually a pretty chill experience. You can complete the regular mode in 90 minutes or so (with practice included). The regular mode has a ton of checkpoints and you can teleport to the last one that was activated, and the NEW GAME+ seems to be a 'start to finish', but I haven't tried to beat it.  There is some collection content, as well as a few extra things to find like a hidden dev room. You can also buy hats and even get a golden skin on NG+. The level design overall was not bad, there are a few visual changes as you progress, as well as some psychological effects, although I think you probably could have done more with navigation, given there are so many movement tools.  [h1] Pros: [/h1]  (+) You get the ability to transform into different characters with unique movement, so for me it makes it a bit more interesting than say, a generic game in this genre  (+) Not sure if it was intentional but it kinda reminded me a lot of many bad Playstation 1 games, you know like those movie adaptation games, the real trash. But in a very charming way. It seems clunky at first, but I kinda got a good feel for the timing after a few minutes. Very silly narrative, the game does not take itself seriously, overall I thought it was very cute.  (+) On regular mode there are many checkpoints and you can teleport to the last one you used. Also if you teleport too many times, the game will offer you to skip to the checkpoint at a small price. The shadow is also very nice for tracking the landing  (+) Can unlock many hats, and there is some collection support. Can replay on NG+ with mostly no checkpoints it seems.  [h1] Feedback: [/h1]  - I had occasional issues with the character not grabbing the edges for some reason, and sometimes moving objects would affect your movement in strange ways  - Maybe the game could have used a few more sections for the skateboard, like designed for it. Also the places like that dev room, I wish you had more side activities like that, what makes a game like this fun for me is optional exploration, so something to keep in mind  - The camera in the horror section was a little wild  [b] Overall Thoughts: 7/10 [/b]  Just something you might enjoy for 90 minutes if you ever experienced like a meh Playstation game, the ability to change characters made it stand out for me among similar titles. Nothing too special, but for the price I think it's decent effort, made me smile a few times with the design choices, also really nice selection of sound effects lol. Even though it's in that ""hardcore platformer"" genre, the game is actually very chill and not even that frustrating.

3394590,The Life and Times of Daniel Vastberaden,184741288,76561198003013967,"Tragic story with easy puzzles and some annoying bugs.  The game is a series of levels or chapters that you choose from a book. There are multiple chapters, and you can begin with any of them, but starting with the first is the only reasonable option because they still follow a narrative. Each chapter contains one simple image on the left page and a story on the right.   Sadly, the story is cut short because the sentence ends abruptly at the bottom of the page. Turning the page simply takes you to the next chapter, and the only other piece of story is included in a diary within separate chapters that is difficult to read owing to the handwriting. Completed chapters are not marked and don’t really lead to much. Epilogue is already revealed and all you get for completing a chapter is an achievement.  Once within a chapter, you must complete it in one sitting because there is no saving. Furthermore, you cannot quit or return to the main menu. The only way to exit the game is to force quit it using the Alt and F4 keys, or to close the game's window by pressing the x key.   It turns out that having all chapters unlocked right from the start is a good thing because of a few annoying bugs. For instance, the fourth chapter crashes the game when you try to use an item. Then, in a different chapter, you can’t leave a room. There’s also one chapter where you can collect an item through a locked container, but this doesn’t prevent you from completing a chapter.  The gameplay is simple. You click on things on the screen and collect those you might need. First thing you need to do is click on various containers, such as drawers or closets, as well as doors to adjacent rooms. A room only has one screen so the camera cannot be rotated. The fact that each chapter takes place in the same house adds to the simplicity.  Hotspots are not identified or labeled, so you must click on everything. Fortunately, there are not very many objects on the screen. If you come across something you might need, you will collect it and store it in your inventory. To use an item, you first activate it by clicking on it, and then click on the desired location on screen. Because an item remains active until you leave the area or deselect it, you can quickly attempt to combine it with everything.  Puzzles are not difficult and make sense. There are only a few rooms in the house so you will not have many options. A chapter may also include one logical problem in which you move objects around to construct a pattern, a locked container requiring a code, or a puzzle in which you use your head.   In the first chapter, you are involved in an accident and lose your head. However, you do not die because you merely bandage it and tie a scarf over your neck to conceal the scar from others. When necessary, you can detach your head and use it as any other inventory item. This creates some morbid situations, such as placing the head on a broom or using it to connect pipes.",True,7,0,130,124,0,1798,1736000086

But it just doesn't feel there.  Pros:  -Love the flash game vibe  -The forest puzzle is very straightforward. Great for a first taste.  Cons: -There's no intro into the guitar. Like, it's a bit confusing how it's meant to be used. I think it would have been good during the intro to have a little ""Hey, play ""this"" to make sure you're in tune quick"" or something just to cement it into your mind. Cause I got to a point where I had solved pretty much all the puzzles mentally, but for the life of me I had no clue how or where to enter the answers.  -Volume. It's on or off. I like the ambiance but the volume itself is too high. If nothing else I'd just like a slider of off, medium, full.  -there is no in game/pause menu. So, Alt+F4 it is.  -full screen you can see the cut off on the left side of the screen  -At the big fretboard looking wall, the bit you uncover goes back to covered if you leave the screen or bring the guitar up  -Some spots seem hard to tell where you'll go. The stairs especially. Maybe adding some arrows or cleaning up how they look would help. Maybe just adding a tiny bit of brightness when you hover over the spots?  -The main menu lets you just jump to any point in the game without playing them.   -B-side is has loud static going through the background noise the entire time and is just frustrating to listen to. I muted before starting it too, but it still played.    So yeah. Lots of issues but the biggest one is going to be the guitar. How do you use to to solve anything? I dunno.  all of the other puzzles make sense. I can solve them just fine. The moment the guitar is needed, I'm lost. It's like I said above, it would be great if there was some moment at the start where Syd wanted to make sure she was in tune or something.

3393930,Justice Ninja Casey,189025318,76561198300785269,"Originally released exclusively in Japan on Nintendo's Super Famicom system, Shonen Ninja Sasuke has gone on to become a rarity in Nintendo's library of Japan-only titles. Sealed copies in particular, have sold upwards of two thousand dollars apiece in the past. Fast forward thirty-plus years, and Sunsoft have decided to finally release Sasuke in the west as 'Justice Ninja Casey'.   Besides being a note-for-note conversion of the Super Famicom original, Justice Ninja Casey's story has been translated in English for the first time ever, allowing players outside of Japan to experience Casey's quirky humor without the need of a rom hack, walkthrough or Japanese translator. For purists hoping to keep the original Famicom experience intact, Ninja Casey includes the option to switch Casey's text back to Japanese. Full box and manual scans in Japanese are also provided for viewing in-game as well.  Like other recent re-releases, the ability to save and load states at any moment during gameplay is a welcomed addition. Players can also fast forward and rewind gameplay, with the ability to customize the speed of such in Casey's options menu. Additionally. players now have the option to activate in-game cheats such as invincibility and unlimited energy; making playthroughs of Ninja Casey a cinch.   Perhaps the most unique gameplay add-on is local co-op; allowing players to complete Casey's story online.  Though, Justice Ninja Casey isn't without it's flaws. The same slowdown that plagued Shonen Ninja Sasuke when one-too-many enemies were on screen is also prevalent in Justice Ninja Casey. I've also noticed random sprite glitches with out of place tiles appearing in the background, or townsfolk becoming a glitched mess when attacked by the player. While these glitches can be played around, they appear often enough in the later portion of Casey's story mode to become a regular occurrence.   Pro's ----------------  - The original Super Famicom port in all it's 16-bit glory. - Fast forward and rewind features with customizable speed settings. - Save and load state feature able to be used at any point of gameplay.  -  Local online co-op - Gallery mode with manual and box art scans, along with character sprites. - The ability to switch to Japanese for players pining for the original experience.   Con's -------------  - Noticeable slowdown at few parts of gameplay. Just like in the original. - Noticeable graphical glitches towards the end of story mode.   If you're a fan of classic beat 'em ups such as River City Ransom, Streets of Rage or Double Dragon with RPG elements lifted from the Legend of Zelda, I recommend giving Justice Ninja Casey a try. The added features, translated story and attractive price point are all good reasons to test out this hidden gem from Nintendo's yesteryear.",True,7,0,186,177,0,28,1740805401

Pocky & Rocky meets Cho Aniki. Not as polished as the gameplay of the first one, not as amusing as the second. Also, lots of very specific japanese humor (they really think muscular guys are very very funny). If there is an argument for digital games vs physical is the release of obscure items like this one. A boxed cartridge of this game is not exactly a cheap option, neither is the game that hot to deserve hitting your wallet that hard. If you are into weird and odd japanese games give it a shot. The gameplay is both easy and obnoxiously difficult because of its broken and clunky physics (those jumps, my god) but again, you are getting this so cheap, and in english, it might encourage other obscure japanese games to finally come to this side of the planet (Cosmic Smash for the Dreamcast, a ton of rpg for the snes and ps1, shmups, etc).

3393450,Timeloop Titans,189971180,76561198003013967,"Its bland visuals, uninspired gameplay, and unbalanced mechanics make for a dull experience that’s only made worse by its unrealistic pricing.  The plot is as standard as they come. You’re the lone hero in a spacecraft, fighting wave after wave of enemy ships. To its credit, the game does sprinkle in some lore elements to spice things up. Through a codex accessible from the main menu, players can read about the protagonist, enemy, and even bosses. It’s a nice touch for those craving some context, but it’s hardly enough to carry the experience.  On the gameplay front, things are stripped down to the bare essentials. Aside from basic movement, your sole task is to hold down the fire button. That’s right—no frantic button-mashing required. However, the omission of gamepad support feels like a glaring oversight for a game of this genre.  You have four ships to choose from, but only one is available from the start. The others must be purchased with in-game cash. Each ship boasts different stats in speed, health, and damage, but in practice, they all feel pretty much the same. Even if you switch to a new ship, you can boost its stats with cash earned from destroying enemies, further minimizing any real sense of variety.  Combat feels hollow and uninspired. Enemies have health bars but go down quickly, leaving little challenge beyond the occasional need to dodge their colorful bullet sprays. The only time things feel remotely exciting is when you snag a power-up. Homing bullets are the clear winner, while speed boosts and other pickups feel almost pointless due to their brief duration.  Boss encounters are more frustrating than fun. The game’s attempt at bullet-hell mechanics feels imbalanced. Your ship is simply too big to maneuver effectively, and there’s no “grazing” mechanic to reward precise dodging. Instead, you’ll find yourself absorbing hits with little hope of survival if you’re overwhelmed. Visually, there are no surprises. The endless starry backdrop is as generic as it gets, and enemy designs lack any real creativity.  The game’s structure doesn’t help its cause. Bosses appear out of nowhere after a few basic enemies, forcing you to wipe them out quickly to leave room to dodge during the boss fights. Once you beat a boss, it’s back to the same monotonous cycle of enemy waves until the next boss shows up. When you go through all of them, the game simply resets them and you start back with the first boss. There’s no objective, no meaningful progression—just an endless loop until you inevitably die.  The most baffling aspect is its price tag. For a game that offers little content and weak gameplay, the decision to price it as a mid-tier indie release feels out of touch. This is a game that might have found a place as a budget title, but at its current price, it’s impossible to recommend.",False,4,0,35,35,0,1798,1741722935

There's a funny bug that makes it so you can see the other person's flashlight beam when they've store it in their wrist, but you can't see your own when you do that (except on certain specific surfaces, like the other person's flashlight beam). We were using discord for audio, and we couldn't find a way to turn off the in-game audio, but it was close enough in sync with discord to not matter.

At one point you are told to use ""the secondary button"" for something, which in our case meant clicking in on the thumb stick.

It blends walking-simulator vibes with occasional interactive moments, offering a story that's more about feelings than grand action. If you’re into games that tug at your curiosity while giving you just enough to piece things together, this one might intrigue you—but it’s not without its quirks.  [h1]About This Game [/h1]  [h2]Storyline [/h2]  The game’s story is like a quiet whisper: subtle, melancholic, and a bit haunting. You’re sitting with “her” in an old school building, chatting about random things—her game, the world, and memories. It sounds serene, except for one jarring detail: she’s already dead. Yep, this isn’t your typical slice-of-life story. The game leans heavily on its atmosphere, offering a sense of nostalgia mixed with unease. Nothing overtly dramatic happens, but there’s a lingering tension, like you’re waiting for the other shoe to drop. It’s a bit ambiguous and hard to follow at times, but that mystery is part of its charm.  [h2]Gameplay Mechanics [/h2]  At its core, this is a walking simulator with some light interaction. You explore, examine objects, and piece together the story through what you find. There are no quest markers or time limits, so you can take it slow, which suits the game’s reflective tone.  The big twist for this developer’s usual style? Mini-games! They’re a nice addition, breaking up the usual walking-and-talking formula, but they’re not all smooth sailing. There’s a maze section that’s particularly frustrating, with laggy controls and an odd distortion effect that could make your head spin (not in the fun way). If you’re prone to motion sickness, you might want to tread carefully here.  [h2]Visuals & Audio[/h2]  Visually, the game leans on a soft, dreamlike aesthetic. The sunsets are beautiful, casting a nostalgic glow over the schoolyard. The environments aren’t super detailed, but they do enough to set the tone.  The audio is understated, with ambient sounds and minimal music that match the peaceful-yet-unnerving vibe. It’s not a soundtrack you’d put on repeat, but it complements the mood perfectly.  [h1]Pros[/h1] [list] [*] Short and sweet, perfect for a quick gaming session. [*] Unique atmosphere that mixes nostalgia with subtle dread. [*] Mini-games add variety to the usual walking-simulator format. [*] Open-ended exploration lets you enjoy the story at your own pace. [/list]  [h1]Cons[/h1] [list] [*] Story can be hard to follow, especially with fast or confusing dialogue. [*] Laggy controls in 3D spaces, particularly in the maze, can be frustrating. [*] The maze’s distortion effect is a bit much—prepare for possible headaches. [*] Could use a bit more polish to feel truly cohesive. [/list]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1]  TABLE GAME END feels like a quiet poem brought to life—mysterious, emotional, but a bit messy. It’s not for everyone, especially if you’re expecting a polished or straightforward story. However, if you’re into games that focus on mood and atmosphere, it’s worth a quick playthrough (it’s only 10–30 minutes, after all). Just be ready for some rough edges, especially in the maze.  It’s a small indie game with big feelings, even if they don’t all land perfectly. If you’re a fan of the developer’s previous work, this one adds a few new elements to their usual formula. If nothing else, it’s an intriguing little slice of gaming that might leave you pondering long after the credits roll—or at least until the lag wears off.  Rating: 8/10 The developer really loves to confuse his players!

It does have some issues, the story is kinda hard to follow, there are sometimes when text goes too fast or the dialogue is confusing. There is this really bad lag when you turn sometimes in 3d spaces and this becomes sickening in the maze portion. Also the maze feels pretty tedious, I genuinely almost stopped playing since the distortion effect, along with the lag when turning was making my head hurt pretty bad.

No new cool items (what you can get you already have better or your build have more synergy with the item you already have), no cool story elements.   Repurposed characters. It was weird seeing my companion or already deceased characters than realizing it's a different person just using the same character model. Lazy.  The main boss was easy than you are trapped in a cave and you have to defeat 2-3 copy of yourself the mechanic is also repurposed lazy concept already had critics about it in forums. Still they decided that make it twice or 3 times pain in the a* by facing 2 and 3 copies of yourself and if you have hp refill martial arts or items that means impossible. I played on nightmare. Maybe on lower difficulties it is manageable. The trick striping your armor off and changing internal don't work. It seems the game has the copies follow an earlier image of yourself. I don't have patience to experiment from when probably when you first enter the cave. You have to return after defeating boss and than you are already late even if you didn't enter the cave. So maybe someone will crack the info still you have to use an exploit and the fight is still boring.  You can accept defeat and take off armor and accessory to lose these fights than you face another boss who has HP refill ability. He couldn't defeat me but I couldn't defeat him either. With 2 hits he can refill 50% of his HP. So you need to finish him in 1 or 2 turn. I couldn't do it with all my companions. His hp regen is just too much. You can't craft throwables in the cave and even if you could you need so much it would take too long. You could only get 10% his max HP anyway throwables.

[h2][u]Settings, Features & Gameplay[/u][/h2]  Settings & features include; language, display options, resolution, advanced graphics settings, audio controls and mouse and keyboard instructions.   The demo includes three albums to sample. You can also customize the albums with stickers, backgrounds, text and more and unlock more options as you progress.   The demo starts off with a great tutorial that shows you how to play the game and some of the advanced controls you can use to select multiple items at once. There are also hints available if you are struggling with what order the photographs go in (and for some of the larger moments it can be tricky).   [h2][u]The Visuals & Audio[/u][/h2]  Visually the game to me has a very 80’s look to it in terms of colour palette and the hand-drawn elements. The artwork looks painted in watercolours. I really enjoy the vibe the graphics are giving off. In some albums the colours are muted to give the impression of older photos where the newer photos are vibrant. The stickers you collect to decorate the albums are cute, some are for celebrating moments like birthdays with balloons or the arrival of a new baby or your first home. You can also change the background and the background pattern and modify the colours of both.   I really [i]love[/i] the design of the UI. You unzip your pencil case to see your stickers. You can place them anywhere, resize them and even rotate them. You can eat the cookies and your music selections are on a Walkman. You can even take a sip of your tea (it seems we are slurpers) :)   The music is instrumental and very relaxing and light-hearted. Well the one track I was able to hear during the demo.   https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3434162904 https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3434162824  [h2][u]Overall Experience[/u][/h2]  A very wholesome game filled with cute and heart-filled moments from dating, to marriage, having children and ageing throughout the years and all the special moments in between. 💗  [hr][/hr] [quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/32732116-IndieGems/] Follow [b]IndieGems[/b] [/url] for more reviews like this one.

The humour is good, and it works well as a standalone game since there aren't too many references to the events of Virgo Versus the Zodiac, so I would say it's a good game to introduce new players to Moonana games. It's also made me consider giving Osteoblasts another try (I tried the demo a few years ago but couldn't get very far, but maybe now I have more knowledge on what to do in RPGs that don't have timing-based mechanics to help you avoid taking more damage like Virgo and Keylocker do).",True,1,0,337,337,0,17,1735463948

My video can be found here: https://youtu.be/h_TrnRhIqbo   **I haven't played Virgo Versus the Zodiac yet, so my review is based on no prior information from that.**  Ginger's Letter to Santa is a short-ish (~3-4 hour) RPG adventure all about Ginger trying to deliver a letter to Santa! Because let this cookie COOK! You'll team up with a couple unlikely allies on your way to getting to Santa's house, and also have to deal with the Zodiacs trying to stop you! Well, some of them are.  Combat plays out in a turn-based matter. What skills you'll have available to you depend on what equipment you have on, and everyone can wear everything, so long as they have the slots for it! All of your attributes are there, but are named differently. What some of them do? I never really figured those out by the time I beat the game. Destiny is your Health, and Purity is a sort of MP thing.   Counterattacks turn out to be quite good... especially if you combine them with confusion on the enemy! However, counterattacking requires purity, so you'll want to make sure you do actions to maintain it. Or don't, and just spam out different abilities until things fall over.  Status effects in general are... interesting? Some give you bonus abilities to use, some help in... some way? Or you can just throw a bunch of Snowballs. I did that a few times too.  By the end of the game, I was sort of just over combat. Things felt like they were hitting too hard, I was constantly just trying to find the nearest healing spot (either a cauldron or a stove or something), and just ready to be done.  The story is cute, though I got very confused near the end on just... where to go? I mean, I eventually wandered onto it, but then there was something in a later area that was just sort of... there? And I didn't get it.  I'm guessing some of these things would make a lot more sense if I'd played VVTZ, and it's definitely on my list to play sometime.

The final boss in particular is genuinely rock solid in its mechanics even if you look past the central conceit of it.  soundtrack is crazy good, it's half remixed VVTZ tracks to sound even better and half originals that all crack my top 10 from main game, so that's yet another highlight. jokes are good as always as well and maybe slightly better than main game because it's 100% comedy-focused.  the only negative i have is that the two puzzles are kinda dubious, the first having unexpected requirements to complete even if you think you have the right sequence, and the second requiring maybe just a little too much creative meta-style thinking from the player to solve, but other than that, game is great and well worth the price.

Second, sadly the moment-to-moment puzzling gameplay is just not very enjoyable. Especially when a level has many moving parts and many turns, it is just impossible to properly keep in mind which turn one of your characters or enemy character goes where, fights what, and is in what state at that particular turn out of lets say 6 or 7. And honestly it just gets worse over time as new mechanics are introduced that often 'move' as well, which makes the game frankly overcomplicated and headache inducing. Yes, the game is hard as a result, but wont make it fun. I've reached chapter 4, and would have quit much earlier if it wasnt for the good story that kept me going.   Let me elaborate on the lack of QoL. Starting a level has an unnecessary animation and a flash so bright that if I had epilepsy I'd be twitching on the floor with a foaming mouth. Make starting levels instant and remove the flash. Sometimes clicking on characters are a pain bc the hitbox is just not big enough. Placing and removing characters from the board is annoying.

Puzzle game where you traverse a map according to rules like ""you can only traverse this path once"" or ""you can only attack an enemy at most every other turn"".  It's a great looking game but with fairly poor pacing - there's very little time spent on gameplay compared to re-watching the same dull animations like ""round starting"" or ""walking"" around the over-world (stage select) map. There's also a very ponderously told (but at least mildly entertaining) story between each level that could have used 1/3rd as many words and still communicated the interesting or fun bits.  The game badly needs an option to skip all ""flavor"" animations, and single button to skip the story line, or even an option to turn off the storyline altogether. The dev is aware of this sentiment but seems uninterested in addressing it.  Sadly the gameplay exhibits the same lack of polish, with clicks or taps often not producing the desired result. And 100% of the game's rules are hidden behind a hint/info button that I only found out 6 levels in was mandatory to click on for every level. I don't think they really did any proper playtesting on this.  A shame, as I think the puzzle idea is decent, and I enjoyed at least some of the levels, especially when the UI didn't fail me.  This is clearly a ""meh"" title neither deserving a thumbs up or down. I'm going to give it a thumbs up in hopes that the devs will at least improve the UI and cut back the needless UI animations, and in recognition that it's their first game and is far better than many first games are.",True,3,0,54,49,0,366,1736184853

It’s quite a challenging puzzle game where you plan routes for your units, and it gets harder and more complex as you progress. Thankfully, there are up to three hints per level with no penalties.  The best part? Completing each level feels super satisfying, and you’re rewarded with a bit of the story. The artistic quality is top-notch, not just visually but also in how it’s narrated, with professional voice acting that makes it even more engaging.  [strike] If I had to nitpick, I’d say the action execution is a bit slow. A 1.5x speed button would be great, though it also encourages you to think through solutions instead of relying on trial and error.

You are more than welcome to purchase them all yourself, and support the developers, but you can [currently] only use one at a time.  I love the Tiphanie body, but much like others have said, charging the cost of the game just to present your preferred gender kinda sucks. Im down to support the Devs because I think the game is a ton of fun, but a lot of work needs to go into character customization.  NONE of the DLCs being compatible with each other is a HUGE oversight. I love the pastel colors, but I cant be a pastel color, and have the female body type, so Im stuck just running around with a feminine body with a ""normal"" color pattern. I paid extra for the body, and the pastels. I should be able to use both. When choosing your preferred color, instead of it being a ""body"" option, there should be an option in ""color"" to change the color to its pastel counterpart, such as a check box, or even just clicking the color again to change it to pastel and back. The ""body"" needs to have its masculine/feminine options, as it already does, but the body type retains its color option. I can get over the Christmas Sweaters not being compatible with the feminine body because the sweater covers the majority of the body anyway, but if you (MCL) decide to fix one compatibility issue, why not just go ahead and fix the other as well?  Ive never developed a video game before, so I cant say for certain how ""easy"" or ""difficult"" this would be, but if youre going to develop ""DLC(s)"", you should probably make sure everything works together.

The bundle itself contains an option to choose a more feminine avatar shape which is always great to see. As the screenshots show you can have four variables of each which obvious fuels your personal choice. It opens the doors to possibility as the general style of the suits are vastly different in comparison to the base avatar. The hairstyle under the helmet always adds a way to greater customise yourself and opens the opportunity for more styles to be Incorporated at a later date.  Lets dive into the bad points. To begin we have the hair. Say for example you want to wear the suit in yellow but you want to have brown hair, sadly this is not possible. Each suit forces you to have a specific hair colour if you choose to add the hair at all. I feel this should be a separate option to further the unique styles of its player base.  You are not able to combine this avatar body style with the contents of the other DLC. It limits you to the base colours and forces you to wear the exact outfit in the images. If you purchased the 'Winter' bundle sadly you're not able to wear that sweater and this bundles feminine shape together.  In closing. My opinion is that the 'Tiphanie' bundle needs to be worked upon. Separating the hair colour options maybe by adding 'Hair colour' under 'Charms' r a new section entirely. Allowing the 'Contrast' bundle to effect the 'Tiphone' suit. Adding an option for the 'Winter' bundle sweater to become compatible with the 'Tiphanie' avatar.  ",False,60,0,0,,0,23,1734584594

3392100,kubic,183706974,76561197989580996,"Dive into an entrancing world of optical illusions and mind-bending puzzles with kubic. This innovative puzzle game is inspired by the visionary artwork of M.C. Escher and intricate geometric designs. Featuring 69 captivating puzzles to challenge players to construct a specific goal configuration using a variety of pieces (each presenting a unique twist on the puzzle-solving experience). The game boasts a clean and minimalist aesthetic, emphasizing the beauty of the puzzles themselves. This allows players to fully immerse themselves in the task at hand. As players manipulate the pieces, they can change their layer order, overlap other pieces and even hide extraneous pieces behind others (offering a a lot of strategic options). Although this might seem simple, it opens up creative problem-solving opportunities. To aid in the puzzle-solving process, kubic offers several helpful features: the ability to lock layers and zoom in or out for precise piece placement. However, players can also drag the view for a more comprehensive perspective on the puzzle's layout.  If a particular puzzle proves too difficult, players have the option to skip it and revisit it later. Rest assured, every puzzle in kubic has a solution, however, some may require considerable thought and planning. Patience is key in overcoming the game's more challenging levels; this is often beneficial because it allows players to approach puzzles by building figures from back to front. For those who find themselves truly stuck, kubic includes an in-game hint system. This system can provide the necessary nudge to get players started or, if needed, guide them through the entire solution. Developed by Pixel Envision Ltd., kubic offers a resizable window mode and is available in 13 different languages. The game's settings allow players to toggle sound and music, tailoring experience to their personal preferences. With a competitive leaderboard and six achievements to unlock, kubic offers plenty of replay value and incentives for perfectionists.  In conclusion, kubic is enchanting puzzle game which combines the mesmerizing art of M.C. Escher with engaging and challenging gameplay.

The aim is to search the dark woods for clues to find items and places which may lead to rescue or escape, while being alert to pervading sense of evil...    I don't usually play such games, as I don't enjoy jump scares, gore, or chases. But this game is much more nuanced - for the most part danger is suggested by a small sound, a momentary glimpse of something, or a textual description of a foul smell or of a growing sense of unease. Once again I am amazed by how evocative a game can be when using simple low resolution (and mainly monochrome) pixel graphics, coupled with an excellent narrative and design.    The game is played in two distinct phases. The first is mainly exploration; the second is to discover and navigate a path to (hopefully) safety. As I found to my cost, there is no save function or autosave facility; stopping the game before its completion (with one of two endings & achievements) means starting again right from the beginning. I feel that this is understandable; the sense of atmosphere and mystery is maintained better if the game is played straight through to a conclusion. Ignore my play time completely as I restarted the game twice,  and also left it running when I had to do other things.

So, in game time, it took me into the 1950s to beat the misson, which is the start date for older entries in the series. Well... it does fit a nice balance of difficulty and the paper-book pipeline is a nice new resource, and coal is now super renewable.  One thing, which is more an update around the DLC that is super welcome is the readition of planting trees, especially coconut trees. No longer will random map players have to deal with *no more coconuts in this area*. Super welcome, and also helps with wood logs too. Also free, and you don't need the DLC for it. But back to the mission feeling... short. Like I said, 1950s, which is like half a normal game. Heck, I slowed myself down after doing the get to world wars part... And still finished them before 1930. I felt like I slowed down on the Cold war, but I did kind of rush the Modern once I saw that I could do it before 1950. I bet you could do it before 1940 if you rush them. The other thing is, well at least they had Sunny do some task, which is fitting seeing as she's Ms. Treehugger and all.  Buuuttt... That's the thing. Most of the voices in the main cast of faction leaders felt... off after Caribbean Skies, I think. Most notably is the General Rodriguez, but to a lesser extent was Mason who was a bit more high pitched most of the time. Sunny, meanwhile... feels like she's bored out of her mind/dead tired. Sound direction is best when you don't notice things off, you shouldn't notice pops, misreads, or something of the sort. If you do know their job was messed up, they messed up HARD. Given her vocal inflection, and the less missions in the DLCs now, I feel as though this should be one of, if not the last DLCs for 6. Like the only thing I would want in Tropico 6 is Papaya plantations... And with modding available I hope they add that soon. It was a very fun ride since I bought the base game in early access back in 2018, it's come a long way.

The side missions, unlike some where they ask you to gather irrelevant resources, all support the main questline, and are reasonably easy to achieve and serves more to guide your growth path than railroading or are simply boxes to tick. The new buildings start off pretty weak but can be overpowered once you have enough of them and focus on them as a whole, similar to how tourism is handled in the game (if you go all in, it's stupidly profitable, but it takes a while to get there). Campaign mission has reasonable replayability as you could take different paths (skipping vs embracing trees=>coal, using coconuts instead of trees, relying on books vs nature tourism for printing money, etc).

[spoiler]The ending was brutal, and even harder thanks to the enemies being of a way higher expertise than in the previous version of that level.[/spoiler]   Hit and run tactics excel, with brutal CQC gunfights in the more cramp environments recommending you to check your corners often. Playing through some of the cramp levels with the ""Fog of War"" mutator enabled showcases how important room clearing can be when playing this game.   The story is mostly the same, but revised and polished, with more emphasis on Steve's overall mental well-being. [spoiler]Steve is written as a more mentally unstable man, with the death of Charles taking a major mental toll on his mind. So it kind of justifies his brutal actions in the story.[/spoiler]  The soundtrack is a mixture of electronic, industrial metal, and maybe some djent thrown in there for good measure. Most of IV1's original OST is remixed and remastered, and Xtrullor didn't even hold back! It's surprising how he mastered his original craft near back-to-back after finishing IV2's soundtrack!  Out of everything I indulged in, this DLC has only two complaints, and they are spoiler heavy.   [spoiler]The level where Steve engages against eight or so hitmen doesn't end with the original IV1 cutscene art, which showcased Steve standing stoic among all the bloodshed. Instead, it just uses the desktop cutscene art, which I think is a pretty big downgrade.[/spoiler]  [spoiler]Another is the introduction of Mole. In Intravenous 2's good ending, Steve tells Sean that he helped an undercover cop out of a sticky situation. That certain person, is Lee Da, Sean's ""guardian angel."" Well, when we are introduced to him in this remaster, his name isn't ""Mole,"" it's literally Lee Da. To me, this kinda ruins the cool reveal that Lee was in the previous game, since it was up to the player to find that out, assuming they played IV1 before IV2.[/spoiler]  Overall, the Intravenous 1 Remaster is an amazing ""Developer's Cut,"" of the original, with levels redesigned to fit IV2's gameplay loop. It's very much worth the buy, and you can breeze through it in two and a half hours!

All the new dialogue was a welcome change as well, the story seemed a bit more fleshed out than when it was first presented. Having bought one of the bundles as soon they dropped, getting to play around with all the new guns from the supporter pack was fun as well, though the whole experience made me nostalgic for when clearing these same levels was an hours-long nail-biting process of methodically picking off everyone lest I get rumbled and sent back to my only save point. Hell, the epilogue on masochist mode from IV1 and the butchery on true mode from IV2 were the most harrowing gaming experiences I've had in recent memory, but I think I've just gotten too good to go back to stealth.

I will say it takes about an hour to beat give or take 15 minutes so it could be longer, the jump scares are pretty ok and the difficulty is a little lacking. Also half way though the game, it seems to change from”pick this up and keep it in your inventory” to “click and hold to hold this item out in front of you and drag it in physical space to where you need to use it” and that was really jarring and caused me to think the game was bugged, and also at one point I had to check the controls to figure out how to beat the game.

The poor translations are not something that affects game play... if anything they're slightly funny; but overall it was done really well!  There is nothing like this game.  It pulls many original concepts from others; but combines them in a way that no other game has done.  Map graphics are simple and focus more on the game play.  In-battle graphics are pretty good.  Battles play out really well; fighting and skills as well as pathfinding are all very fine-tuned in this area!   Pro's for me:  *Open World    -Progress at your own pace, -Explore where you want, -Replayability, -Cities and Towns; Cities are owned by factions (NOT Static - You can Siege and conquer them!), -Towns connected to cities for side quests, story flavor, etc  *Hero's    -Multiple Classes, -Relations, -Progression System (skills. abilities, traits, and base stats),   *Equipment     -Rarity, -Variety, -Enhancing and -Leveling  *Troops    -Multiple Types (Soldiers, Archers, Horsemen, Healers, Mages... all of which have their own progression trees), -Progression System (troop types, levels, amounts), -Skills/Abilities  *Relations    -Develop relations with each 'hero' and every 'faction'!    *Army    -Each hero leads its own 'squad' which you can assign units too.  Depending on unit type; heros and units can grand buffs/debuffs to other units which is determined by how you set-up your squad (ie; two units of same type next to each other or 'all units in the same row', etc)    -Battle readiness.  Before each battle you can lay-out your squads in how you wish to have them deployed - adding an additional level of strategy before the battle begins.  *Battles    -RTS-style battles with each hero and troop type having their own unique ways of performing.  From formations to skills and abilities to placement - the battles play-out very nicely!  Cons *World Map    -Objectives don't seem to be displayed properly on the map - or in a confusing way - especially if you have a lot of them being tracked.  I assume this is probably going to get worked out with the full release version    -UI in certain areas.  They've done a great job with in-city tab options to quickly go from one section of the city to another, however; There are so many windows and tabs between your character; your armies; the cities, etc... some of them just need a little fine tuning.  Rather it be graphical improvements, informational improvements or navigational improvements; there are many UI areas and 'some' seem to be less user friendly than others.  I DO NOT have a specific example, I do not have any recommendations; nor did I run into any issues in this area while playing.  It just seems to me that this can probably be improved -IN SOME AREAS- somehow.   Demo contains a lot of what to expect out of the base game while keeping you limited to one territory from one faction.  If containing well over 10 hours of gameplay within just the one territory from one faction is a testament to how big this game will be when it is released - I can't imagine the amount of gameplay it will offer in the full release.

3391050,Crown and Adventure / 王冠与冒险  Demo,189186997,76561197992470440,"From what I see, I'd 100% recommend this game when it come out. It is a very ambitious from China to capture the same vibe.  It is the Mount & Blade like I've been looking for. The closest comparison in terms of gameplay is (duh), Mount & Blade and Sands of Salzaar. As advertised, there's 11 classes - from Commander (Support w/ Melee) Mercenary (Tank) to Rogue (..stabby) to Mage to Believer (Priest / Cleric - which can be played as light / heavy armor) to Knight (OP). There's a decent amount of class variety off the bat, and it looks like the game will also give you cultural and possibly race background - so far it is only cultural background and you are limited to Zhao Yang (NotChina) in the beginning.  I started my play by playing as Knight because I'm one of those Elven Male Wizard main and wanted a change. And as expected it is one of the strongest class of the bat - turns out being able to pick your fight and spam your ability is powerful. You lead a ""Legion"" (Army), which consists of up to Y amount of characters you can recruit. Balance is somewhat similar to Dynasty Warriors-like, in that character are absolutely way stronger than normal soldiers in stats, thus avoiding the pitfall of Mount & Blade where Companions are completely outscaled in combat by actual troops for non-utility purpose. This game just embraces the Wuxia / Fantasy trope and make it so that both the heroes + troops are useful. In that sense, it resembles game like HOMM / AOW from a different genre. And I LOVE that.   Command system in battle could do with some work. Current battles mostly feel like F1 + F3 in Mount & Blade and it is hard to give somewhat detailed orders or to pre-arrange my formation.  You'll always want to grind money. Infantry squad goes up to 4 soldier whereas cavalry seems to go up to 2. Another gripe I had with Mount & Blade was how OP cavalry is - it probably still is, but at least this game tries to resolve it by giving infantry a number advantage.   AOE is strong and every heroes have em.  The game's current settings is in NotChina, in a single province, but you can see traces of Western fantasy influence with guns, priest, wizard all available and obviously arts drawn like European. The names could be a bit more creative though, like calling the NotEuropean guys Causcidian or whatever translation they picked is..interesting. And why the Sassinian looks Persian but has an Egyptian priest line? I'm not gonna complain too hard about this though. This is a great game already and will be amazing when it come out.  There's a clan / family system underneath the hood, like very simplified dating sim. Better than Bannerlord. There's a probably under work kingdoms system, it is possibly better than Bannerlord.  Translation is so-so, but I understands Chinese and can fill in the gap with all the corrupt officials trope.  Compared to Mount & Blade it seems to offer power cap on par with some fantasy mod and a decent amount of tactical & strategic variety.  Anyway I'd totally buy this game on release bar major screw up in designs or something. ",True,5,0,1074,261,0,4,1740930991

I have done two separate runs and finish the content below is some of the improvement the game currently seriously lacking.  - Poorly translated ( due to game origin from chinese ) but still playable except just kinda skip thru all the quest dialogues and the item description translation kinda need some tuning.  - Cost upkeep for army is kinda on the high side, maybe the 2nd region would give better quest reward or monster drops. - No fast transportation eventhough you took over all the castle, kinda hassle to move around the map. A lot of hours wasted just going from point A to point B. - Lack of enemy heroes like in the other games they have family lineage members that constantly defends the surrounding kingdom.  - The army promotion relatively one sided improvement unable to demote to choose the other tree when you unlock it later on.  - Gift system at higher relationship required item need to scale down.

Only intending to 'give it a go' I have become completely obsessed and cannot wait for the full release!

Already this seems like a complete and in-depth work of art, and just when I thought I'd made loads of progress, a whole new layer of gameplay unlocked and there's a HUGE amount more to enjoy.  If you've ever played Mount & Blade, or 3 Kingdoms, or any pixel army game with large numbers going at it across the screen, this merges the lot and brings in the best elements from each. Every aspect is easy to understand, well developed, in depth, and clearly paid attention to by the devs. Unlike even my most beloved games, there isn't a single aspect I don't enjoy!

The game promises an accessible yet strategic experience where players can enjoy both active gameplay and passive progress through idle mechanics. It emphasizes resource management, strategic card play, and the development of a sect to become the ultimate ""Sect Master.""  The most notable feature of *最強宗師* is the unique card system, where every card represents a character with distinct abilities, and no card is ever truly ""useless."" This design ensures that players can always find value in their cards, enhancing the sense of progression as they build their deck. The ability to pass resources down without losing progress is another key aspect, making the grind feel more rewarding and less punishing. This is particularly appealing to players who enjoy RPGs but prefer a more relaxed approach to resource management and character growth.  One of the game’s main hooks is its idle gameplay mechanic, where materials can be produced passively even when you're not actively playing. This allows you to continue progressing and strengthening your characters without constantly having to be engaged, making the game accessible for players who might not have a lot of time to dedicate. For those who do engage more actively, there’s still a rich layer of strategy, with the need to carefully plan your card combinations and tactics in battles.  The game offers a variety of modes and gameplay elements, such as strategy setups and diverse playstyles, which keep the gameplay fresh and exciting. The focus on the martial arts world and sect cultivation gives it a unique flavor, especially for fans of this genre. As you progress, you’ll train characters, develop your sect, and climb through the ranks to become the strongest sect master in the game.  However, as is common in free-to-play titles, the game includes in-game purchases and some chance-based elements, which may appeal to those looking to progress faster but could also be a turn-off for players who prefer a more traditional RPG experience with less emphasis on microtransactions. The presence of in-game chat and online interactivity introduces social elements, which could be appealing for players who enjoy connecting with others in a shared game world.  Visually, *最強宗師* presents a typical mobile game style, with vibrant art and character designs that fit well within the martial arts genre. The aesthetic, while not groundbreaking, complements the theme and tone of the game.  In conclusion, *最強宗師* offers a fun and engaging card-based RPG experience with plenty of strategy and a unique idle mechanic. It's ideal for players who enjoy martial arts themes, strategic deck-building, and passive progression. While the in-game purchases and reliance on chance-based elements might not suit everyone, the game's accessibility and variety of gameplay options make it a strong contender for fans of casual RPGs and strategy games.",True,0,0,190,181,0,520,1738378354

The boosters you can get are a neat idea, although the explanations on how they work weren't that easy (at least for me) to comprehend and you don't really have to use them. I've also only rarely encountered any bugs and when I did, they weren't too bad and only minor visual problems.    It would be nice if there were for example multiple different modes you could play this in to appeal to more players, like a classic mode, a mode including the boosters, a mode in which there's a timer, a mode in which you have to get enough points to attack in a set amount of turns, etc - you get the idea. Of course this is just my suggestion and the developer/-s don't have to implement something like that.   Another idea I had was adding enemies that you have to defeat by playing solitaire with different twists, e.g. if you're fighting against this one enemy, you can only stack cards of the same color instead of alternating them, for another enemy you could only be able to stack cards in reverse (instead of K, Q, J, 10... it would be A, 2, 3, 4... including the foundation piles), etc - that way some would be easier to play against and some harder. Once again, just ideas I had that would make this more interesting compared to normal klondike solitaire - if you exclude the boosters.

3391280,Klondike's Hike: A Solitaire Roguelike,189211585,76561198071531076,"6/10 Klondike with boosts and a RPG-like layer  TLDR: It's Klondike by 3 which would normally have a low chance of winning. However, the various special objects on the board and rewards that you get for completing levels usually bring the chance of winning to 100% while also making it somewhat more interesting and strategic. Besides, you don't even have to fully solve Klondike: it's enough to put about 5 cards into each foundation, and you press ""Attack"" button which just means ""win instantly"".  Good: + free + the various special objects in the stacks and the 1-use boosts liven up the game + the RPG-like layers gives a feeling of progress  So-so: +/- gfx look like stubs though I guess if it's a free indie game and also a semi-RPG, it could work. At the very least, the AJQK cards should have some pictures on them, maybe pixelated. Maybe just re-use the images of monsters +/- music track is boring and adds to the feeling of boredom one usually has when playing Klondike solitaire :) There is also just 1 track, so after 15 minutes of play I was tired of it +/- I frankly wasn't sure where to use the boosts. I lost my first 2 battles - and in those I had no boost to use. Then I was winning every game, and didn't need the boosts. They seem situational. Maybe the game needs to show an example of their usage, or in which situations they may be helpful +/- it's supposed to be battles against monsters. Yet you just accumulate points and then press attack. Instead, it probably should be many attacks. I understand that the delay is there to let the player unlock any possible brown reward chests on the board when the game is already won. But, as it is now, the combat part feels underdeveloped  Bad: - controls feel glitchy because the card seem to only get placed on the target stack if the mouse cursor is over that stack. It should place the card also if just the dragged card is over the stack, even if the cursor is away from that stack  Semi-bug: if all 3 slots for boosts are filled and you win a battle that gives a lootbox reward, you can't pick any extra boosts and also can't close the looting dialog. That's how the game ended for me, as it just got deadlocked.  Overall, it's a laudable attempt to marry something as trivial as Klondike solitaire with TBS/RPG battlers. I'd say the game exceeded my expectations, because if anyone wold tell me they want to use Klondike for a TBS game, I'd reply that they'd be wasting their effort since nothing good can come out of solitaire. Yet here it is. Still, it's probably the lacklustre aesthetics that bring the game down. It certainly needs something to keep the player awake. A story with jokes, maybe some funny animal sound effects (enemies are beasts after all). Maybe some fireworks or other particles to accompany pickups or attacks. One has to keep in mind that the old Win 98 Klondike was mostly played by people who were stuck at some office job and couldn't install any software, and also wanted to be able to Alt+Tab quickly to some MS Excel spreadsheet they're supposed to be working on when their boss enters the room. Here it's a game that attempts to look like a hardcore RPG/TBS game, so it won't have the privilege of getting captive audiences that have nowhere else to go :) So, this game has to fight and keep the player awake!

I think the game can have good potential with speedrunning by managing the chocolate consumption to go faster, combined with the surfing location and the bunny hopping.",True,6,0,149,149,0,249,1736695181

Beat it in a single sitting, started off getting to grips with the controls then once I figured out what I was doing I blasted right through it, then spent a couple hours getting the rest of the achievements I could get in single player. I really wanna pull someone in on this so I can try multiplayer out (also for that last achievement I'm missing). Definitely grab this if you're into weird visuals, jumping around desolate megastructures, and air strafing i.e. quake, tf2. And a note for my fellow movement freaks, don't expect to get too deep in the weeds of classic movement tech. You've got bhops, air strafing, surfing, and something similar to rocket jumps, but you won't be building up too much speed off air strafes alone, the rocket jumps don't behave exactly how you'd expect, and outside of surfing slopes don't really change your jump angle. Big plus to this game too is the dev already fixed the largest bugs I experienced, A+ dev moment kisses 4 u mwah",True,5,0,271,201,0,13,1736074679
