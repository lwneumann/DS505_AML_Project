You're a little dude with a bat who runs around smacking balls into bricks that are baddies.    To assist you are power-ups like moving faster and having a bigger bat, along with enhanced balls such as a chicken that lays 'egg' mini balls, a cowboy ball that shoots, and a bomb that makes explosions on contact. As the levels progress, the 'bricks' get more numerous and tougher, and even start shooting back!    Completing a 'round' of play unlocks new characters with different starting abilities. I really enjoyed playing as them because they add a different challenge—and some are just a riot!    Overall, this game delivered exactly on the experience that I thought it would.😊 Bravo!",True,1,0,1740813811

This game is so simple but at the same time so hard, It's like Balatro but with more math and strategy and less art. If you suck at doing math you will probably suck at this game, so don't go leaving bad reviews because of your own capabilities. There are already multiple game modes with more to come in the future so I will be waiting for that in the full game, a suggestion I have for the future is some kind of 1v1 multiplayer mode with some sort of ranked mmr but that would only happen if there is a large active playerbase.

It takes too long to sap all o my starting +N or xN cards to make first cool combo, it would be nice to have some effect that upgrades their value or swaps them for a bunch of random but not too risky cards. Yes, you have some abilities, but aside them being expensive, I'm talking about some effect that you can consistently use in every run. 2)Counter that shows maximum and minimum potential value of a card when you zoom in. It's fun to calculate stuff, but not when it's your 10's refresh of a shop and you are looking for a specific thing. 3)Stop the draws if you hit especially lucky combo. Sometimes you press space multiple times to grind money, it would be nice if a game stopped when multiple cards lined their effects up. ""Wait, I got a billion? When? How?""

Starting with game modes: all avalible seem intresting, but for me idle and relaxing seems too random, like im hoping that i will get good items in shop and then i NEED to hope for best outcome in auto draw with fixated slide to left, i see no point in theese game modes rn. The strategic mode on other hand is good and enjoyable, with all implemented mechanics it's engaging to play around with different cards and combos you could find. And i could'nt say that about abilities, yes there many of them but 85% of them are just ""repaint"" of first, and many abilities are super narrowly focused, litteraly unplayable with most of builds. For unimplemented modes i could only say that they seem interesting. The game has alot things to fix/balance/implement until it's release, and one of things that i would like to see is some sort of new characters, new decks to play with, wich will have diffrent starting cards (or ability) and of course new cards to mess around with.

I tried a handful of games at the recommended settings (relaxed, 500 turns) and only once did I manage to break into the millions. The card buy system is ridiculously off the charts: some cards are very overpriced for their weak effects, and other cards that would be useful are forever out of reach due to their price at the game stage you're at.

I've quit too many games because of unreadable font/font sizes.) + Soft music that isn't intrusive and rather enjoyable to zone out to. + The cards, for the most part, are understandable and easy to learn. + It's a game you can spend extra time on when you're looking to kill time or fill up space.  Cons: - The wording of the ability cards can get a little muddy or confusing if you haven't discovered some things. (or, if you're dumb like me.) - The chips flying upper right towards the screen did give me a minor headache (I get motion sickness from games so there's that.) - Some folks might find the white against black too striking.

The foundation for a decent puzzle rogue-like is there with the Strategic Mode, but I'm not really seeing the complete picture right now.  I get that there is supposed to be a strategic use of buying stuff since it directly takes from your score, but I have zero incentive to care especially in things like relaxed mode where you can't manually place the cards you draw.

3409820,186368080,76561198330888468,"Played only one game so far, but I liked it.  I will say it isn't what I expected. I thought it was going to be more like a hexagonal version of 2048, and while there are minor similarities, it is pretty different.  First off, turns are not about all the pieces moving in one direction, but picking one piece and moving it.  Second off, it works on multiples of four, so half you pieces can never merge with the other half. Fours become sixteens becomes sixty-fours, etc., while eights become thirty twos which become one hundred and twenty eights.  That said, it is still fun and clever.  For starters, as long as you can make groups of four, no new pieces are added to the board, as soon as you cannot, five more are added to the bottom. You can see what numbers are coming, which is a little useful, but near as I can tell, placement is random into empty spaces. It can help you decide which not matching move to make, as newly dropped units will merges groups of four if it matches.  Note that if you can make a larger group, a set of five or more, they all merge, but the total remains four times the amount on one of the tiles. This still opens up more of the map, so that is still a good thing.  There are also two tactical actions you can take, shuffle and a bomb which takes out one space. These cost you energy, which defines how many moves you can make before the game ends.  Making a match will add one energy, so eventually you will run out.  I get the impression that faster actions might give you more energy in a combo, I need to experiment more with this.  There are a few oddities, for example most of the time the four will merge into the space where you placed the last tile, but not always, not sure why.

At first, things feel pretty normal—you’re just doing everyday tasks and chatting with students. But as you go deeper, the stakes slowly rise and unexpected stuff starts happening.

I’m running it on an i7-8750H with a GTX 1050 Ti—definitely above the minimum specs—but still only getting around 15–20 FPS. I tried lowering the settings, but it didn’t help much. The choppiness did mess with the experience a bit (though weirdly, it kinda added to the creepiness sometimes).  What Could Be Improved: 1. Map System You do get used to the layout as you play, but the first few missions can be a bit frustrating since you don’t really know where anything is. A simple static map would go a long way in helping new players find their way around without wandering aimlessly.  Final Thoughts: For an indie horror game, this one really nails what matters most: story and atmosphere. Yeah, the performance could be better, and it could use a map, but I still had a great time with it. If you’re into horror games and can overlook some technical hiccups, I’d say give it a shot.  Final Score: 7/10 – Spooky, story-driven fun with some rough edges.",True,0,0,1744136329

There will be feedback/updates to take into account to perfect it and make it better!   Updated: Was able to give pastries for cafe customers [put them on the register table and hit space]. I thought you would have to give change like you do the register, but they don't so you just need to grab the food and hit space. I'm still playing through the demo, enjoyable so far.  Some notes:  The register doesn't have $20 bills or 10 cent coins, which made it annoying to give change (other sim games I've played have always had these two items). It threw me off a lot and I kept giving incorrect change often.  It would be helpful if there's maybe a pop-up on big change return mistakes -- for instances I accidentally didn't give someone $96.84 in change -- whoops. Maybe if it's $10 or more in disparity, there's a confirmation box? And maybe have an option to turn this feature on/off because I could see that bugging some people if they don't care about mistakes.  I would love the ability to set specific prices rather than just a percentage. This way I can make items in the store a more even number for easier change / cash.  It would also be nice to see an order history for the items you purchase ahead of time.  Could not move furniture!! That MUST be updated as it's impossible to rearrange the store.   It would be great if there was a way to open up the tutorial -- I didn't see a hotkey anywhere, I think it goes away when you open the store for the day.  Great Lo-Fi (chill) music in the game so far, I like that part, would be great if they had more for variety. The graphics are a step up from other market sim games and is pleasing to look at. The third person POV is too close up and would be great slightly zoomed out a bit more.  Would be interested to see how this game develops but it's definitely very early stages (since the game isn't out yet). If they put effort and updates to this game it could have potential to be great. It is concerning that the demo is a struggle if this game is supposed to come out within a month.

Also, I can't move furniture or am I just missing the hint on how to move the furniture that was already bought and I wanted to rearrange? I had to sell them and re-buy them just to re arrange them the way I want.   There is no time indicator, just a notif that the day/shift is over. Would be better to add cleanliness, wait time, accuracy of order i guess, to earn or lose reputation points. While I do like cozy, it can be a bit repetitive so challenges like keeping the cafe's reputation would make it exciting. The coffee making is easy click - could do some realistic coffee making. Also the espresso machine just makes 1 coffee at a time when there's 2 slots.   I've been looking for a decent cafe simulator and this one seems promising.

However, the game in it's current state is quite buggy and broken in many ways and there are a lot of problems even with the mechanics that function as intended.  Some examples of this are; - The hitboxes of NPCs and certain objects in the world are huge for no reason and can block entire paths/stairs until you find the perfect invisible gap to squeeze through. This occurs quite often in the game and is very frustrating, often leading to reloading a save because you get outright stuck sometimes. - The combat is frustratingly repetitive and a lot of enemies have far too much health, making most random encounters boring slogs that don't really add much to the game. If the combat was more balanced or better yet, revamped completely this would be a far better game. Once I realized I could turn off random encounters. I began to enjoy the game a lot more. - Audio from one line of dialogue overlaps with the next when you skip through dialogue. - Inconsistencies with what words a character will ask you to translate vs what words the game actually prompts you to enter. - The 'speak' function to enter words using a microphone does not work well at all. - Sometimes the text will suddenly change to French for a sentence or two mid-conversation, before switching back to Spanish.  - A lot of spelling errors. These are just the problems I can think of from the top of my head I'm sure there are more I am forgetting. All of that aside the game does have potential and some charm.

There are only 40-ish hours of lessons available at the moment and a lot of bugs/other issues. For example, there are times when it asks you to type out an answer, but it asks for it in French even though I'm using the Spanish version (it does accept the Spanish terms, though) or the spoken sentence you're supposed to type out not triggering so you take damage for ""getting it wrong"" in certain scenarios. If things keep progressing forward and the bugs get worked out, I feel I will continue to recommend WonderLang once it is actually finished.  I already had a bit of basic knowledge to start from as I have been learning Spanish on my own for work, which also helped me progress quickly through certain parts of the game. However, even with the issues in the game, I can honestly admit that my conversational Spanish has gotten better (as noted by my native Spanish-speaking friends)! There are a few things I would like to see happen with this game - more games like the English-Spanish word find puzzles to help you test your knowledge in addition to quizzes and combat, the opportunity for your character to be any gender you choose so you can use proper grammar with nouns and adjectives regardless of what gender you are, and some descriptions that explain all of the options available during combat instead of me having to type it into Google so I could translate it first and make choices (some are obvious like ""escape"" or ""objeto"").",True,1,1,1742351708

I am a big fan of first person puzzle platformers, and have played many in the genre since the gold standard set by Portal then by Portal 2. Many of these games have been good in various ways, but lacking in other ways. Many have been duds in major ways. A handful have been quite excellent. ChromaGun 2 (demo) really nails it though: it has challenging puzzles, but no so challenging that you're stuck for too long. It has platforming/environmental puzzles.  It has (multiple) cool visual styles. It has decent sense of humor, and lines delivered by  professional voice actors. It has hidden secrets. It has good performance.  It has many nice little touches that remove annoyances if you make a mistake. An example of what I mean is that there was one section in the demo that is almost pure platforming of about 10 or so jumps. However, after every (one or two) tricky jump(s), you can flip a switch to allow you to redo that jump in an easier way should you fall and have to redo that section. So the penalty for falling off the platform is not as bad as having to redo all the tricky jumps again which would be a bit frustrating. It's like the developers got together and asked themselves, ""what are some of the little annoyances in typical first person puzzle platformers games, and what can we do to eliminate them, so that what's left is pure fun?"" Really appreciate that! Also, the jumps in that section weren't even that that tricky. I dislike it when in some games you have to run and time pressing the jump key oh-so-precisely so that you just make it across a gap. Then it takes you 5 tries to nail it.

Only annoyance I had was in the last puzzle (chicken puzzle), I got the bird all the way to the last section before a jump, but I happened to use the same color Orange, the same color I had also used around the area you enter.

There's so much more happening - dynamic objects, dynamic environments, dynamic lighting rule-breaker - possibilities to unlock your own puzzle-solving creativity & style thanks to the level design that has drastically improved from the 1st game, allowing you to complete stages the way you prefer it, no longer following only one strict/rule way of doing things, faster than light - speed-running options for the attention seekers, the competitive souls, a drawing room for the Picassos, rainbow of colors - not to worry, because ChromaLabs thought of everything, with it's amazing accessibility options allowing everyone experience to the fullest this one of a kind adventure, dynamic & extremely well executed dialogue & narration, setting up the bar even higher, an even more intriguing story at ChromaTec, you just gotta love them, and our favorite even more amazing chroma-verse music!

3408840,188570425,76561198135518501,"ChromaGun 2 (Demo!) is a puzzle platformer which surprised me with a good story and challenging puzzles, especially for a demo. Often enough, the story and the complexity of the puzzles in a demo are reduced to a bare minimum, not showing too much to make people buy the game. In this case however, the demo is perfect for exploring what the game is about. It even has enough replay value due to achievements and collectibles.  The demo teases a great and deep story which can't hide behind other great puzzle platformers, most notably Portal. While the story shares some similarities with Portal (“Testing”), it is clearly not a clone. In the story, the player is guided through different dimensions with very distinct styles. Each dimension has its own sections with puzzles to solve, and a different narrator. Judging from the demo, it seems like there's not much choice the player has about the story; there are no branches, no different endings. It would be easy to spoil more parts of the story, but it's even easier to say: Just play it—it's worth it!  Gameplay-wise, it looks very similar to the first part ChromaGun, though I can't really tell as I haven't played it. The player has the ability to color specific plates and objects in the level using the Chroma Gun. These colored plates will behave like magnets for various gameplay objects with the same color. The challenge is to color the correct plates in the correct order to manipulate the level so we can finish this section and continue.  The colors themselves are oriented around three primary colors (red, yellow, blue) and their secondary colors (orange, green, magenta). Those secondary colors can be achieved by mixing the primary colors accordingly.  It's worth noting that at some point the plates and objects are “overcolored” and just turn black, deactivating any magnetic behavior. This, and the fact that some objects can't change their color, is used as an additional puzzle challenge.  Throughout the demo there are challenges of varying degrees. While some challenges can be solved very easily by just looking around and coloring two objects, others require careful thinking and also thinking outside the box. One challenge even let me pause playing to continue at a later point. Yes, the demo is not just made for a single testing session—you can enjoy it multiple times!  The graphics of the game are kept simple, there's no over-realism or hyper-realism. The image is clear to read, there are no strange lighting artifacts or blurring happening. Various effects and animated objects fill the otherwise almost sterile levels with life. And did I notice some very well known Niagara effect somewhere?  Other than that, it's hard to judge the game graphics based on the demo and in total. Each dimension has its own art and graphical style, one going into a more organic direction and the other looks like a comic. Each style however looks very well thought out and matches the dimension.  As a game developer, it would be quite interesting to take a look behind the scenes and see how they achieved those different styles. And of course, I noticed a few things that I'd have done differently.  In total, the ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard demo is a wonderful demo that showcases what a demo in 2025 can be. It gives a good taste of the story, and has a lot of replay value for a demo by making use of achievements and collectibles. The gameplay covers a nice range of easy and complex puzzles, I sure hope they can find the right balance in the final game. Pixel Maniacs, good job!",True,1,0,1740309012

Reading the PDF gave me some insight on the struggles one person can go through, and it's impressive that the game saw the light of day as a consequence. It also confirms my suspicions behind the flaws of the second game (I don't view Til Death Do Us Part as a sequel).   It indeed has artwork images, 76 to be exact. 74 comprising of ingame CGs or concepts/sketches and the other 2 are thank you images in English and Chinese.

My favorite is the promo concept art of FLoDT2 (not of Til Death Do Us Part).

[h1]Gameplay[/h1] The main menu could use a bit of polish. You can play in either Streamer Mode or Adult Mode. The Instructions option turns on game hints when you play, which are as clear as mud.  There are 100 different women to unlock, you have to unlock them in order. When you select a woman you get a plane animation taking you to some place in the world. This really only affects the background of the current challenge.  You get a, from what I could determine, random amount of mana, from two to ten. Drawing a card costs one mana. Playing a card also costs one mana. You damage your opponent when you attack a space that is not occupied by a card.  My basic strategy was to keep all of the card slots full, and using any extra mana to put cards in my hand. There didn't seem to be a limit to the number of cards you could have in your hand.  Cards are very basic. In general, the attack is half of the cards hit points, and they all cost one mana. There are no special cards. Card values seem to be random, within a set. My first battle I had 1,000 hit points and attacks were higher values. The next two battles I had 100 hit points and the maximum attack was 10.  [h1]The Gallery[/h1] The Gallery is accessed from the title page. All of the women are unlocked in the Gallery when you start. The Gallery is like a very, very, very, long corridor that you walk down. The icon of the woman is on your right and the card image is on your left. You can only pan your vision left and right.

I felt like I had gotten the hang of the controls by the end of the demo, so great job! Some critiques: The writing is a little weak, feeling like forced exposition and tutorials instead of actual characters sharing information. I feel like giving each character more personality through HOW they say things (not necessarily what they say) could increase immersion. Also the dial puzzle's controls were really confusing until I noticed the actual dial in the top-right corner. Hopefully bringing more attention to that instead of the UI numbers will reduce confusion.

FREE to the Public, again over on my Patreon :)   Before I start this review, I would like to extend my thanks to the Digitaly Arts team, for joining me on stream to discuss/ reveal their project Time Breaking: Dino Breach. I loved meeting every single one of you and I'm super excited to see how you develop the game further!   REVIEW:   I want to start this by saying that Dino Crisis will always hold a special place in my heart. Since a very young age I have enjoyed many retro classics at the time of their releases and Capcoms Dino Crisis is one of them.   My first impressions loading up this demo, is the subtle nods to the Dino Crisis franchise. Time Breaking: Dino Breach also has a ""This Game contains explicit violence and gore"" load up screen and behind this message is scene from Time Breaking: Dino Breach. For those of us who lived through and experienced Dino Crisis at the time of its release, this Demo is an adrenaline fuelled shot of nostalgia, and to be honest, I'm all for it.   There are many Dino Crisis Easter Eggs dotted throughout this demo. I have enabled comments, so please feel free to leave a comment telling me which DC/DC2 Easter Eggs YOU have found! To list a couple that I've found, are for example; the DDK like puzzle for the hacking machine (if you know, you know), numerous letters and notes with some character names paying homage to some characters called the same name in DC (Gale) DC2 (Paula, David). I wont list much more as I don't want to give too much away.  Being able to play a video game again where you can slide a bookcase to reveal an entrance or a cart to reveal an unlocked door, is something I didn't realise I missed in modern day video gaming. Its a simple mechanic, yet its one I've come to realise, I've sorely missed. The music and sound composure is another take away aspect of the Time Breaking: Dino Breach experience. Being able to explore the facility with violent rain hammering against the glass, the spine shivering, hair raising hiss of the Raptors when they start to close in on you, followed by the music, dialling panic mode all the way to 100. [DA] Carlo and the team have done an amazing job so far in creating an immersive, unfamiliar, yet familiar experience.   The Time Breaking: Dino Breach UI is both beginner/advanced player friendly. Its clear to understand whilst also complimenting the overall player experience. Those of you that have played DC/DC2 will appreciate the simplistic UI design, whilst also noticing a Digitaly Arts twist. The sounds and music accompanying the UI and its navigation sounds add additional immersion, the UI boasts clear inventory item placers, the amount of those items you currently own and if you're like me who's new to PC Gaming, controls on how to navigate and exit the inventory menu are located at the bottom of the screen.    Kate's character model is one that doesn't look out of place especially regarding modern day video game characters. Her voice actor did an incredible job portraying Kate's character and emotional state during certain parts of the demo. I personally cannot wait for the release of the Full game.   ONE THING THAT ""BUGS"" ME  Reflecting on my time playing the demo, there is just one thing that bugs me slightly. The handgun/pistol fire rate I feel needs to be tweaked. If memory serves, I think that Capcom & their Dino Crisis/ Resident Evil handgun/pistol fire rate was similar, however I feel that pistols in games beyond the DC era have increased their fire rate, except for heavy handguns like the Desert Eagle for example.    Personally I'd rather have less damage output but faster fire rate regarding handguns. Noticing how the Raptors respond to gunshots i.e; staggered / stunned, the handgun could be used as a stun and move gun regarding its standard ammo. However, the handgun could become a more formidable weapon when you craft/find its FMJ ammo variant. To provide balance and QoL (Quality of Life) you could make FMJ craftable ONLY,  and spread out the FMJ ingredients throughout the game in lesser quantities. Ideally you could find the ingredients closer to boss battles or areas which are considered more difficult in the game.   Other than the fire rate, I don't have any other criticisms. The demo has played smoothly for me and I haven't experienced any bugs in the demo so far. I've currently replayed the demo several times whilst recording for my YouTube video breakdown of Time Breaking: Dino Breach   That being said, The Time Breaking: Dino Breach Demo is a promising, nostalgia driven teaser brought to us from a talented & passionate team of devs!   Those of you who may be reading this, I urge you to try the demo out for yourselves. Again feel free to comment on my review, your thoughts on what I've highlighted/ your experiences of the Demo. Like I stated above, I am currently creating a YouTube video on my Time Breaking: Dino Breach experience and any comments on my review may be used.    Thank You for reading.

The isometric view style is a nice touch and does a lot to add to the atmosphere. I did notice a bunch of bugs with the inventory and menus but no doubt they will be fixed in time. The inventory management, map, storage and save system being that of previous Capcom games is a big win. The ambient sound design and score is great but the voice acting is a bit flat and hopefully just a placeholder. The writing on the notes is a little strange too as though all the notes were written to be read by someone that doesn't know anything about the facility or the people involved. It comes across as very out of place and silly. Lastly the gun play felt a little off and slow in both dinosaur reaction and actually firing the weapons.   That said, as someone that has been wishing for a new Dino Crisis since the early 2000's this looks to be the most promising attempt at filling the void I have seen.

The demo is rather short, which might be holding it back some in terms of giving a complete picture of the story. I think a lot of a player's enjoyment is going to stem with your familiarity / desire for a new Dino Crisis; as Dino Breach feels a bit above average in terms of execution.

I have counted a couple: left tab, right mouse, Key F - i think its a lot of variety and inconsistent. Would be nice and more intuitive to have one master key to exit any prompt, menu. - Minor detail but in the inventory while rotating the model of the shutgun and handgun, the models do not rotate around the middle of the screen. Or at least the shotgun for sure as it can go out of frame while looking at it. - Joypad support would be appreciated but maybe thats self explanatory and planned already. - Maybe a slight feedback on the sound design: it was cool to somewhat hear the raptor that was outside while Kate is inside the building but in the outside area if the raptor is alove on the balcony and Kate is running on the ground floor outside you can still hear the raptor with the same volume as it was in right front of her.

In order to patch the game you must go to Kagura Games website and download the exe file to update the steam version with the patch. Without the patch, the game is a buggy mess. With broken animations, and softlocks to name a few, but with the price you pay for, you shouldn't have to accept these issues. So the remainder of this review is going over the patched version.    I enjoy this game, the deck building feels fun and rewarding when you find good synergies. The pixel art here is phenomenal and breathes a lot of personality into the Succubi and other monster girls you fight. For those that aren't after a difficult challenge, there is an easy mode to help you.     If you are in this for just the H scenes, these are very well animated and have a good variety. The music in the game is what you would probably expect from a game like this. It helps you get settled in, but it is pretty easy to hear that they don't loop it very smoothly. This is a small gripe. There is also plenty of reason to do more runs besides just trying to beat it. As you encounter events or creatures, they get added to your gallery for your viewing pleasure. There could be a few QOL improvements, like the ability to skip through dialogue. But what is here is very well put together.     Honestly, if you like deck building rouge-likes and are after great H scenes. You can't go wrong with this title. Just don't expect the depth of some of the more popular deck builders like Slay the Spire and Balatro.     Just remember to download the patch from Kagura Games Website if you buy this.

While it may not offer the deepest strategic complexity compared to genre giants like Slay the Spire, it compensates with a streamlined, engaging gameplay loop and a well-integrated Lust Gauge system that keeps combat exciting. The deck-building aspect is solid, and though it lacks multiple archetypes, relic choices allow for varied strategies. Whether you're optimizing your deck for survival or intentionally walking into seduction traps, every run presents a fun challenge.  The game’s biggest draw is its pixel-art erotic content, which is both well-animated and seamlessly woven into gameplay. Unlike many adult games where H-scenes feel disconnected, here they happen in combat, creating a unique risk-reward dynamic. The monster girls are beautifully designed, each with distinct seduction techniques that make encounters memorable. The variety of animated scenes, from pixel-art battle animations to full-screen CGs, ensures there’s plenty to enjoy visually. The breast physics and fluid motion add extra appeal, making the experience feel polished.  Of course, the game has some limitations—it lacks permanent progression, meaning each run starts from scratch, and while the H-gallery is a great addition, a full unlock option would have been welcome. There’s also no voice acting, which could have added extra immersion. However, for what it sets out to do, Succubus Forest succeeds. If you're looking for a well-executed erotic roguelike with high-quality animations and enjoyable deck-building mechanics, this is an easy recommendation. An instabuy for fans of pixel-art adult games.

3408020,189025444,76561198099227311,"[h1]Review [/h1] [h2]✒️Overview [/h2] Succubus Forest is a short but entertaining deck builder with roguelike elements, that tells a simple tale of heroism in which the protagonist must follow the mission of the goddess to defeat the leader of the succubus that is at the end of the dungeon of the Succubus Forest. The task is not an easy one, since besides having to overcome huge amounts of enemies to get there, he will also have to endure the constant sexual temptations that the succubus provoke (showing him her breasts, rubbing against him, flashing panties, etc.).  [h3]🎮 Gameplay [/h3] For those familiar with the roguelike/deck-building genre, this game, like many others, will be very familiar to Slay the Spire, since the interface is similar, sharing many mechanics, although in the end Succubus Forest ends up being simpler, since besides the gameplay it also focuses on sexual content with numerous animations. For starters, this title does not have different heroes or starting decks, but is limited to only 1, and the only difference between the beginning of one game and another is that you can choose 1 of 3 ""relics"" that give you a bonus for the entire run, which can help you orientate yourself on what type of deck archetype to create (defensive with armor, combo with low cost, powerful cards but high energy cost, etc.). Another notable difference with respect to Slay the Spire is that in this game you cannot choose between different paths, instead this game follows a system ""on rails"", where although the events are random (fights, treasures, encounters, recovery zones, improvement zones, shop and bosses) the game itself dictates them and it is up to you to overcome them. For the rest, the gameplay is not much different from other similar games, starting with a basic deck that you can improve with cards you get by winning battles or finding them in encounters. In battles, you start with 3 Energy (which can be increased with Relics), draw 5 random cards from your deck, and there are Attack, Armor, and Skill cards. The only difference between Succubus Forest and other games is that during fights, in addition to a life bar, you have a lust gauge that increases when enemies perform erotic attacks on the protagonist, which not only give him a debuff, but also increase his lust. This gauge is important because the lust level is maintained between fights, and when it is full, the enemies can rape the protagonist until they suck all the life out of him if you fail to overcome the QTE that occurs during the act. It is worth mentioning that although this game follows roguelike mechanics of randomness and multiple attempts, the protagonist does not get any permanent bonus, so whether it is your first game or your tenth game will always have the same difficulty, so you will depend entirely on your skill and luck to choose cards or ""relics"" to overcome the 50 floors of the dungeon, a task that is not at all easy [spoiler] considering that the final boss has two phases with lots of life and debuffs[/spoiler]. Fortunately, the game has an easy mode where you get bonuses of strength and defense, which makes the adventure much easier if you just want to enjoy the sexual content.  [h3]🔞Sexual content[/h3] [h3]Note: You need to install the +18 patch from the publisher's page or you will not see any sexual content. *You can add me if you need help.[/h3] This game has a decent amount of sexual content with 30 animated sex scenes, 21 of which occur in full battle with pixel art the size of the character's sprite, and 9 pixel art ""HD"" that occur in full screen and are unlocked in special events during the game (it is worth mentioning that because you depend on luck for these to occur, so it is impossible to unlock them all in a single game). The quality of the sexual animations of both girls and HD, frankly, is exquisite, the movements are fluid, erotic, plus they offer a variety of sexual positions, which is quite lustful. Of course, the best animations are HD, because you can see in more detail the sensual body of the succubus (uncensored) without losing that attractive pixel art, although the negative is that they do not have a very high duration, since they are mostly loops where you decide when the protagonist ejaculates. In terms of sexual fetishes, given the nature of the title, most of the content is focused on female domination or reverse rape, so the scenes you see have to do with services of all kinds, blowjobs, handjobs, footjobs, assjobs, boobjobs, breast rubbing, flashing, breast-feeding and threesomes. There are also traditional vaginal sex scenes, although they are in the minority. Where there is more variety to satisfy different tastes is in the girls, since in addition to the typical sucubus with huge tits, there are also monster girls such as slimes, bunny girls, maids, cow girls, cat girls, plant girls, etc. So it's easy to find one that suits your personal taste. This game has a replays gallery where you can see both combat animations and special events, but unfortunately there is no option to fully unlock it even after finishing the game, so if you want to see all the content of this type, you will have to play several runs.  [h2]💭Conclusion[/h2] In a few words, this is a short game, but it is a game that satisfies both in terms of gameplay and onanism. While it is true that they are not as complex as other erotic deck builder themed games I have played, such as X-Angels,  Take Me To The Dungeon!!! or others, as there are not many different archetypes to create, nor do you have to strategize beyond building your deck. However, this is offset by the sexual content, which is not only limited to sexual reward scenes or events, but also occurs during combat, which helps to keep your little friend ""awake"" if you prefer to play this game one-handed. So with that said, I definitely recommend this game for those looking for both gameplay and sexual content, if you also have a taste for pixel art like I do, this is definitely an instabuy as you won't regret it.

If you like puzzle games of this sort, where a lot of the solving and effort is actually done outside of the game (In your head, on paper, etc.), this is for you.  There were only 3 things I disliked, 1) The font size, on some screens it was hard to read. 2) I was able to unlock book 4 before book 3, which made me pursue the tougher puzzle first, I got stuck here for a while because of that, and the fact I'd never solved that type of cypher before. and 3) Lack of narrative, there could be a little more to the story, like a wall of text at the beginning just saying who you are and why you care about this case, it would take very little effort but add a lot to the game I feel.

3407080,186811659,76561198042044934,"Khatun is an amazing deep character that I have had a lot of fun playing with for the last week. She's the first true assassin we've gotten since Nuxia, and she's a concept I feel is done right. She needs one single change to be perfect, and then she'll be a solid addition to the roster.  Khatun is a deflect master hero. Her kit revolves around either getting her into her deflect or pressuring enemies with soft feints to bait a deflect. Any recovery you have you can soft feint into a long forward dash. During this dash you can either throw incredibly fast lights, throw a unblockable that pins, dodge away to the sides, or automatically deflect any attack that lands on you and confirm that same unblockable from earlier. The major issue with her effectiveness is that the pin does [b] NOT [/b] go through hyper armor, and is how she gets a majority of her damage.   Aside from the run, you can do a lot from the soft feints. She can feint heavies into a bash, lights and another heavy. Her lights after a run can chain into these soft feint heavies as well, plus the run itself has almost no recovery frames when you finish it. Meaning if someone tries to wait out your forward dash mixup you can parry or dodge anything they try and do right after it.  She just has so many interesting match ups that make me really enjoy her. If a character uses a side dodge bash to try and punish a recovery cancel run that you do, you can cancel that recovery cancel into a side dodge and punish it with your own dodge attack. Is an enemy doing empty dodges on your soft feint lights because you can recovery cancel into deflect? Soft feint into a heavy instead and her tracking will punish them good. It's just so fresh and fun. I really love it.",True,0,0,1738318633
3407080,186479756,76561198066395949,"Khatun is a great example of a character that was created based on a good concept but likely designed by someone who has never played For Honor in their life nor watched footage of the game beyond maybe a character trailer.  The character has an auto-deflect, being a 'deflect master' and has an interesting playing style. The problem? Their deflect is a multi-hit combo pin that is interrupted by hyper armor.   There's a lot of characters, popular ones too, that have easy access to hyper armor. So much so that if Khatun tries to do their deflect, they actually lose against someone just doing a regular attack combo. This invalidates the deflect and read.  This is not a problem for full block characters, as those stop hyper armor attacks (kyoshin, conqueror, etc). Khatun does not. If you deflect highlander's light, which normally on a full block character would grant you the upper hand, you'll instead be hit by a high damage hyper armor attack.  Here's hoping they will change it, which they might, but this sadly goes to show that this was either designed by an AI or someone who does not know how basic mechanics within For Honor interact.",False,15,1,1737917945

In each level, players must locate a designated anime character or, in the final levels, various objects such as a rock, chicken, or document, hidden in buildings, basements, or outdoor settings. Most levels offer multiple locations connected by paths, stairways, or doors. The challenge arises from the target character or object being concealed among many similar items or placed in less obvious spots (I found myself clicking on nearly everything that resembled a doorway or tunnel in some instances), or, in the case of characters, being partially obscured or moving quickly. There were moments when I was unsure of what I had clicked to find the character or object.

Here’s what I liked: •	An interesting setting and great design that conveys the right atmosphere of heat, sweat, and napalm. There’s also a balance between the seriousness of the overall theme and the fun brought to life by the inhabitants through sound and textual elements. •	Impressive performance considering the developers' limited resources and workforce constraints. I was pleasantly surprised—no critical bugs, lags, or frame drops. The game runs excellently. •	Significant variability in how each level can be completed. Every mission can be approached differently, using various supplies and perks. Additionally, the procedural generation ensures that each new playthrough feels unique, both in terms of difficulty and enjoyment. •	Personally, I like that the game is hardcore and doesn’t go easy on players, but at the same time, I found everything fairly intuitive, with no difficulties in getting used to it. The survival elements are well-implemented, forcing you to think through every action and manage resources wisely. What’s missing or could be considered drawbacks or potential issues: •	Currently, the game lacks a variety of melee and firearms. The variety primarily comes from resources or secondary weapons (grenades, C4, etc.). •	At the moment, gameplay consists only of completing separate missions that are not interconnected. This might deter players who prefer a storyline or progression in their games. However, this is just a demo, so this might be implemented by release or in the future if the game gains enough traction. Overall, I recommend trying this game regardless of whether you’re a fan of the genre or have never played such games before. I believe the game deserves attention. ",True,4,0,1736011017

Recommendations for full release * Full adjustable UI for a more vertical setup. * Easier UI for Programs and the program box, something like a card book would go a long way. * The ability to know where a quest is going to be before I start one so I can multitask. * Somethings with the UI are not intuitive, for example I didn't know I could hatch eggs in the program box, and I'm not sure I can delete extra programs.  Dream Features * Asynchronous multiplayer battles against other B.I.T.S would be awesome. Something without a internet connection that uses a image file so people can bring their custom ones. * Have a virtual pet companion that can be raised and evolved as you play, with them being equipable to your BIT to provide enhancements.  V-Pet Ideas * The companion V-pet could grow similar to games like ""Monster Tale"", ""Sonic Adventure 2 Battle"", ""Digimon World"" or even the ""Vital Hero"" toy. * The V-Pet should not punish the player for not playing as the game is already designed to be idle, like how when your away from the Chao Garden in Sonic Adventure nothing bad happens. * A V-Pet dex to encourage the player to try different ways of raising their pets to collect them all would be cool.",True,2,0,1742492414

Berserk B.I.T.S sorta accomplishes that vision, in it's own neat little way!  As this is an idle game, most of the time player input is rarely needed. Most of the time you'll just be watching things happen, the only time you actually need to do things is when you need to drop your Bit onto a section of the map, renovate it's home and also feeding your Bots (which is important since they give you your battle chips) and of course reading E-mails (both in-game and IRL if you so choose LOL)  The biggest thing about this however, is the Custom Bit function. As you can imagine this lets you bring your own little cyber-buddies to life or even characters from other games. It's easy as hell if you've worked with sprites or just pixel art animations in general and has plenty of space for Bits of all shapes and sizes. But it could definitely allow for more customisation, which could be probably achieved with the bitconfig file since it's really not doing much other than telling the game ""hey, files are here"" and if the game gets Steam Workshop Support later on after its release, it could make sharing Custom Bits easier, and allow for more stuff like a save file icon, additional frame settings for specific animations, a Custom Bit Name so the game doesn't just say ""BIT"" in the corner, maybe customised dialog for to make them more personalised, and of course custom bit device colors to match.

The cost to create helpers are quite high, and you really can't be too idle until you create an Auto Shaker helper to passively collect money & hearts to heal your B.I.T. Your bots/pets (which generate battle chips) also create a lot of poop which can be a hassle to clean up without the cleanup helper, and cluttered game windows can cause the game to freeze for a split second when you attempt to click something. The data bit & treasure chest costs to create these two helpers should definitely be lowered to make the starting experience smoother.  A small detail that should absolutely change is what your B.I.T. does during exploration when faced with opening a Mystery Data or moving forward while you're idle. Your B.I.T. should always go for the Mystery Data. There's no reason for it to skip opportunities to mine desperately needed data bits. It's another minor annoyance that keeps you from really being idle in the beginning.  As is, Berserk B.I.T.S is alright.

It is a sort of Idle Game style one and has elements from Animal Crossing-ish games too. Now as an idle game, thankfully it isn't like those countless idle games you see on the App Store that are nearly impossible to get far in without paying money, in fact it has zero microtransactions (and from the looks of things, it will probably stay that way in the final version). The Coin Generator Programs, though requiring occasional shaking (unless you get the auto-shake upgrade), can handle that for you. Note it is kinda grindy, don't expect this to be a game to speed-run.   Most of the game sort of plays itself and you just have to feed your chip crafters and know when to use your health programs. It's meant to work in the background and does pretty well most of the time for that. Another cool thing, there's an in-game sprite editor so you can make your own custom character (think like Minecraft), I always love those. From the looks of things, it might get additional updates and upgrades as it goes on. I kinda can see it working well on the IPhone App Store too.   Some things I want to see in the final version. -Make there a little more control over your character. Most of the time he doesn't dodge hits and I just have to take the blow and hope my Health Programs and Health chips can let me outlast them. -Add other upgrades besides level ups. Being able to customize your character's build would make for a more interesting experience. -Change the name from Battle Chips. I just don't want Capcom filing a lawsuit for that name used.

As you improve your levels and items you can buy automation bots like an auto shaker and auto feeder for your programs to help the idle nature keep going.   Alongside the fighting there is the massive customisation home area. You can decorate it with plenty of items in a style that suits you. All entirely cosmetic but it's going to sit around your desktop so you want it to look cool.   All of this is packaged in a really cool looking UI that's looks like a PET and based on the idea of having a Tamogotchi or Digivice.   Overall it's not the deepest idle game but it oozes charm. A nifty little idle game that's pretty fun to keep at the bottom of my screen and I'm excited to dive into the full release! Definitely recommend checking it out.",True,0,0,1739056325

I have a lower end laptop and it doesn't cause any slowdown or overheat (AMAZING!) and I still get to enjoy the game in both autoplay and manual combat. To those of you who have never played Battle Network 4.5 Real Operation (because it was not published outside Japan), this is pretty much similar to that experience, but now on your operating system of choice with no need for physical chips or an expensive chip gate! I had a blast having this play on stream, infact I'm having BBX farm as I write this. My only gripe is that Data Shards (material component) are so tedious to farm and most save for one automaton requires so many of them just to have *one* earlygame, not a huge fan of that otherwise. I imagine that won't matter though on full release if there's gonna be tons of automatons and variety to build with rather than the selection given currently. Part of me also wishes there were a few other things, Stream Chat Interaction, Manual Controls besides chip selection and moving your B.I.T. around, more enemy attack types than just shockwaves (I know that might make the game harder but it's visually appealing!)

I decided to get in touch with the developer to see if they could allow me to check this demo out slightly earlier than the publicized release of it. ----  I gotta say, this demo was a good introduction for me with Idle Games, feeling like a Life Sim management between setting up your own personalized room alongside building up money to make it better. Then from there, merging this with Battle Network mechanics such as collecting Battle Chips and using them for your automatic fights, where you can choose to let the game use them on its own, or you can strategize your own timing of unleashing them upon enemies.  This being an Idle Game, it also means I can allow this all to happen while I'm doing other things on my PC, and there's even ways to further pull this off so as to let the game run itself with even less manual input on my end of maintaining my given space. ----  I haven't done too much with this demo build, but I still suggest keeping track of this game to its full release, whether you're a fan of Idle Games and/or if you need some kind of further little Battle Network itch scratched beyond Capcom's own recent Legacy Collection of the series.

I will say that Berserk B.I.T.S shows immense promise based on the Demo alone! The kind of Battle Network style game everyone's been looking for since MMBN series released. Even to the point that Custom BITS are already an option, if a bit of a challenge to make. Perhaps that will change at full release.   You focus on managing your 'Home Server' more than battling. Some may consider that a negative, but there's still plenty to do to interact with the game. You have to feed your Programs (which is not your BITS/Net Navi), in order for them to produce chips that your BITS can use in combat. You have the option of setting the Battle Chip use to auto or manual. You also have to think about your timing on when using certain chips! (IE, you need to wait for your BITS/Navi to be in range to use a melee/slash chip, or make sure they are in the correct lane for sending a slow or medium moving attack down that lane at enemies, or timing barriers/reflects.)  The Dev has been super involved with the community, talking to people, taking feedback, noting bugs, suggestions or ideas! Absolutely eager to hear our opinions and finding ways they could improve the game as a whole.  As of right now, there are certain functions not present in the Demo that you can see in the trailer. Moving around the screens is currently locked to FullScreen mode.

The humor in this game is never dumb, in fact it is quite intelligent, but it is absolutely crass. Hence the difference between being a dumb parody and being an irreverent one. This is entirely the latter. The Looker is another title that invokes the same ""Its not dumb, its irreverent"" narrative, because despite mocking The Witness the entire way through, it is always innovating on its puzzle design. Here, we are being irreverent of Ace Attorney Visual Novels, always pressing, always presenting evidence, of course there is a splash of Danganronpa in there, but mostly in the visual design, but I will say that nod to Case 3 Syndrome is well done, as [spoiler] Case 5 took me easily 50% of the time and I still think Case 3 is more bonkers. [/spoiler]  With that out of the way, Explain yourself. Explain how a Ren'Py Free-To-Play game is able to grip me for 10 hours straight as I actually lose my mind trying to grasp the game. For about the first half of it, I was in a call with 4 other people who were playing Helldivers as I listened to them frequently die to bot and bug based problems. My computer isn't powerful enough to run Helldivers, but over the course of playing that first 4 hours I lost my marbles. At one point, my brother said ""I think [General Ginger], that you would understand the game better if you weren't sober."" And eventually I had spoiled some funny moments, notably a finale in Case 2, a message to every gamer in Case 3, and a deceptively early scene in case 5. Eventually I started streaming this to everyone in the call and I think that my brother parsed it best ""I don't want to keep watching, but I can't look away"" and then another friend of ours made it even more concise when he said ""You are doomscrolling this game.""   Either way, I ended up left to my own devices for the last half of the game, which all turned out to be one case. Like I said I saw some postgame content I needed to parse (When I didn't have the threat of a horror section over my head) and would highly recommend this experience to any immortal who has been 12 years old since 2012, and any person who ever was on the internet while they either have Autism (like myself) or on shrooms. The gameplay is like a sidegraded version of Phoenix Wright, the writing is about that of the person who made Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Abridged (the one where Phoenix sends everyone to the sun and shoves ladybugs down their pants), and the memes are plentiful.  Here is a fun game for you at home: Read the Bio pages when they pop up for each character, and spot the references they make to that song as they casually speak. I can assure you, every song is important. I played ""Spot the reference"" with every piece of media available, and also played ""Attempt to accurately describe the game to a colleague while not sounding like you are having a manic episode or a drug trip or both"". All 3 of those are fun games to play.   Of course I had to get through as much of the story as I could, because when I find something cool to talk about, a seven nation army couldn't hold me back.

But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took up arms to defend our way of life against the Separatists. In so doing, we never suspected that the greatest threat came from within.  The Jedi, and some within our own Senate, had conspired to create the shadow of Separatism using one of their own as the enemy's leader. They had hoped to grind the Republic into ruin. But the hatred in their hearts could not be hidden forever. At last, there came a day when our enemies showed their true natures.  The Jedi hoped to unleash their destructive power against the Republic by assassinating the head of government and usurping control of the clone army. But the aims of would-be tyrants were valiantly opposed by those without elitist, dangerous powers. Our loyal clone troopers contained the insurrection within the Jedi Temple and quelled uprisings on a thousand worlds.  The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated! Any collaborators will suffer the same fate. These have been trying times, but we have passed the test. The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger. The war is over. The Separatists have been defeated, and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society, which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. An Empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body and a sovereign ruler chosen for life. An Empire ruled by the majority, ruled by a new constitution!  By bringing the entire galaxy under one law, one language, and the enlightened guidance of one individual, the corruption that plagued the Republic in its later years will never take root. Regional governors will eliminate the bureaucracy that allowed the Separatist movement to grow unchecked. A strong and growing military will ensure the rule of law.  Under the Empire's New Order, our most cherished beliefs will be safeguarded. We will defend our ideals by force of arms. We will give no ground to our enemies and will stand together against attacks from within or without. Let the enemies of the Empire take heed: those who challenge Imperial resolve will be crushed.  We have taken on a task that will be difficult, but the people of the Empire are ready for the challenge. Because of our efforts, the galaxy has traded war for peace and anarchy for stability. Billions of beings now look forward to a secure future. The Empire will grow as more planets feel the call, from the Rim to the wilds of unknown space.  Imperial citizens must do their part. Join our grand star fleet. Become the eyes of the Empire by reporting suspected insurrectionists. Travel to the corners of the galaxy to spread the principles of the New Order to barbarians. Build monuments and technical wonders that will speak of our glory for generations to come.  The clone troopers, now proudly wearing the name of Imperial stormtroopers, have tackled the dangerous work of fighting our enemies on the front lines. Many have died in their devotion to the Empire. Imperial citizens would do well to remember their example.  The New Order of peace has triumphed over the shadowy secrecy of shameful magicians. The direction of our course is clear. I will lead the Empire to glories beyond imagining.  We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We move forward as one people: the Imperial citizens of the first Galactic Empire. We will prevail. Ten thousand years of peace begins today.",True,0,0,1739281930

There were a week or two where I did nothing but play Birdworld all day. That being said, I was not paid or commissioned to write this review, and the playtesting work I did was all voluntary and for the love of the game.  Birdworld's Demo is an artistic masterpiece. It may not be the most mechanically ground-breaking game, or the most colorful game, but it is a game that was made with great care and with great vision. I have been following the development of Birdworld since it's inception, and I have really seen how much love and effort has been put into it. The dialogue, the music, the enemy design, and even the concept is a true reflection of the developer's soul, and you can feel it during the playthrough.  Practically, it plays similar to Undertale. The characters are funny, the dialogue occasionally makes me audibly laugh, the combat can be challenging and is certainly skill based, there are so many puzzles and secrets, and areas to explore. My first save file took me about 16 hours to 100% this demo, with 4 hours spent on just the main progression (It was on itch.io before Steam). The story is engaging, but it is a game that requires your attention and requires you to read. It is a story game, and dialogue is the primary way the story progresses (though not the only way). The Birdworld demo is not perfect, but it doesn't need to be. The charm of it comes from what it is, being raw and personal, instead of sterilized and empty. The amount of content and detail of the demo is rather surprising, and might lead you to forget it's not the full game. I am looking forward to the full release of Birdworld, where the story takes us, and what happens to the lovable Adam.  tl;dr, great game made by 1 indie dev, over the course of 4 years. great characters, story, music, dialogue and good combat.",True,1,1,1737092856

It’s your job to sneak around, devise clever strategies, and even toss your own head at foes to retrieve your belongings. Sounds absurd? That’s because it is—in the most delightful way!  Stealth, Strategy & Snailman Antics At its heart, Crashed is a stealth adventure with a quirky twist. The Snailmen guards may seem goofy, but they’re surprisingly clever, making it a fun challenge to maneuver through the facility, dodge security cameras, and discover inventive routes to your pilfered spaceship parts. While the gameplay is straightforward, it encourages exploration and thoughtful planning.  The Head-Launching Feature – Both Brilliant and Amusing B.O.B.’s removable head is what makes this game truly unique:  - Use it as a projectile to hilariously take down guards. - Snag Snailmen heads to access new areas or sneak by security. - Enjoy the chaos as enemies frantically pursue you to reclaim their lost heads. It’s a delightful blend of humor and strategy, resulting in moments of pure comedy and unexpected thrills.  Quirky Appeal & Surprising Depth Beyond the laughs, Crashed offers a surprising amount of charm. From B.O.B. nostalgically exclaiming, “I miss my wife!” to the Snailmen’s unwavering quest to protect their heads, the game is brimming with personality. It’s simple yet oddly engaging, making you cheer for B.O.B. as if he were an old buddy.  Final Thoughts ✅ B.O.B. is charming, and the world is a joy to explore. ✅ Stealth mechanics are fun, combining challenge with humor. ✅ A unique gameplay concept that’s both chaotic and clever. ❌ Some bugs and quirks, but nothing that ruins the experience. ❌ Very basic stealth mechanics—not ideal for those seeking deep complexity.  If you enjoy lovable characters, quirky humor, and lighthearted stealth gameplay, Crashed is a delightful and imaginative adventure that’s definitely worth a try. Just dive in!",True,1,0,1738310973

When B.O.B. leaves the safety of the crash site to reclaim his ship parts, he knows he may be caught. And yet, for a bot who can detach and reattach his own head at will, what does it truly mean to lose himself? A simple inconvenience. A calculated risk.

3405220,188494686,76561198003013967,"While the story sets the stage for the adventure, it isn't the primary focus of the game. It provides the necessary backdrop, explaining how the realm was overrun by monsters and transformed into a sprawling dungeon. However, it doesn’t delve deeply into lore or character development. The core objective is straightforward: assemble the strongest heroes and retrieve three keystones to restore order.  With the narrative taking a backseat, the gameplay and combat mechanics are what matters. Combat follows a turn-based system, with an action bar at the top displaying the turn order for both heroes and enemies. This bar also reveals upcoming enemy attacks and their potential effects, such as poison or burn. Players can gain additional insight by clicking and holding on any monster to view detailed information about its attacks.  Each hero has four unique attacks, which can be examined similarly to enemy skills. Instead of relying on mana, heroes use action points to execute their moves. Every turn, they recover half of their maximum AP, but stronger abilities require more points. If a hero lacks sufficient AP for an attack, they can draw from a shared pool called team action points. These points are replenished by weakening or defeating enemies, adding a layer of strategy.  In addition to standard attacks, players have access to spells that provide offensive, defensive, healing, or support benefits. Spells can be cast at any time but come with lengthy cooldowns. Players can equip up to four spells at a time—one from each category—but most must be unlocked before use.  A crucial mechanic prevents players from spamming basic attacks that cost a single action point. After one use, their cost increases, making it impossible to perform the same attack several times in a turn. This restriction resets at the start of each new round.  The game provides ample information to facilitate tactical decision-making. Enemies indicate their intended target with an arrow, which also displays expected damage and hit probability. Basic attacks can miss, but special attacks always land—albeit with cooldowns to balance their reliability.   Another notable feature is the enemy health bar, which includes segmented boxes beneath it. Each successful attack removes a box, and if all are depleted, the enemy loses its turn. These boxes regenerate at the start of the enemy’s next turn, allowing players to time their attacks strategically to interrupt powerful hits.  Progression is structured across three chapters, each composed of multiple acts, culminating in boss fights. Each act serves as an independent run featuring several waves of enemies, followed by a boss encounter. The game allows players to pause and resume their run, but completion is required to unlock the next stage.  Staying true to the roguelite genre, players choose their next battle from a map, selecting encounters based on difficulty and potential rewards, such as health, money, or artifacts. Completing a fight grants the opportunity to upgrade one skill per hero, but choices are random. Occasionally, players will also obtain relics that persist through the run, offering bonuses like increased AP recovery or enhanced attack power.  At the end of a run, players receive money and special artifacts. Each chapter features a unique artifact that acts as a progression gate, preventing players from becoming overpowered too quickly. These resources are used to enhance existing heroes and recruit new ones.  Despite being limited to a three-hero team per run, the game offers a roster of 15 distinct heroes. Each is categorized by role—such as healer or tank—and rated across three key attributes: attack, defense, and utility. While base stats remain fixed, heroes can improve their abilities through a streamlined yet effective skill tree system.   Upgrades may enhance attacks, such as adding a poison effect or striking twice, but choices are limited by each hero’s predefined skill tree. Additionally, skill trees may unlock new spells for the spellbook or relics that become available in future runs.  Overall, the game delivers a deep and engaging turn-based combat experience, rewarding careful planning and strategic execution. Its blend of roguelite progression, tactical battles, and meaningful upgrades ensures that each run feels fresh and rewarding, even as players strive to conquer the ever-challenging dungeon.",True,7,0,1740231197

Sounds intense, right? It definitely is. You’ve got different Delvers, unique abilities, and a whole bunch of strategic choices to make. And let’s be real—this game will test your patience and planning skills.  [h1]About This Game [/h1]  [h2]Storyline [/h2] The game doesn’t shove an overly complex narrative in your face, but there’s enough mystery and intrigue to keep you hooked. You’re diving into dungeons filled with corruption, fighting off monstrous creatures, and trying to cleanse whatever evil is festering in the shadows. It’s the classic ""dark force lurking in the depths"" kind of story, but it works well with the roguelite structure. The real charm is in discovering bits and pieces of lore as you progress.  [h2]Gameplay Mechanics [/h2] Here’s where things get interesting. Dungeonfell is turn-based, which I normally wouldn’t be super into, but it’s actually really fun. You assemble a team of Delvers, each with their own skills, and fight through different dungeon biomes. There’s a good amount of strategy involved—choosing your team composition, deciding which paths to take, and making the most of your abilities.  [h1]Pros[/h1] [list][*] Fun, tactical gameplay that even non-turn-based fans can enjoy. [*] Loads of strategic depth with different Delvers and skill synergies. [*] The Cosmic Delver Map gives a real sense of progression. [*] Decent story that doesn’t overshadow the gameplay. [*] Solid art direction and atmospheric audio.[/list]  [h1]Cons[/h1] [list][*] The UI, while good-looking, can be a little sluggish. [*] Bugs here and there, like abilities targeting the wrong characters. [*] If you miss the tutorial (like I did), your first run might be painful. [*] Some turn-based mechanics might feel slow for players who prefer fast-paced action.[/list]  [h1]Conclusion[/h1] Overall, Dungeonfell is a solid roguelite with a ton of replayability and depth. The team-based mechanics, different routes, and ability synergies make for a fresh experience every run. It’s got a few rough edges—some bugs and a UI that could use a little more polish—but nothing game-breaking. If you enjoy tactical RPGs, or even if you don’t but are willing to try something new, this one is worth checking out.

Absolutely not!  As mercenary, Lilith definitely numbers among the loveliest and most badass characters in game, and her outfits are all top-notch as befits a lewd Yakuza minx. However, this just makes the disappointment about her mascot all the greater as the model and its animations are of a rather poor quality. The design just doesn't wow like her Halloween [i]Slutty Pumpkin[/i] version or Lola's [i]White Rabbit[/i] model did.   The most obvious flaws are the mascot's animations, which are not smooth but come off as rather jumpy. There is obviously not enough geometry in her body model to support smooth and soft transitions in high curvature regions which appear somewhat angular and edged. This is most evidently the case with her boobs due to unrefined loops and residing edges resulting in noticeable deformations on the mesh when at rest or during animations. Another negative point is her somewhat weird facial expression that makes her look sad, or just generally upset, giving her the appearance of a clumsy little anime girl.  On top of that, the excessive price tag of more than 50 USD is just off the charts insane! I grabbed her for around 34 bucks during this year's winter sale, but the few extra resources you get in addition to this poorly modeled mascot still offer little value for all the money. If the devs would at least fix the various flaws in the mascot's design and add Lilith's awesome Halloween-style model to the DLC as well, then it would probably be a good deal if you ask me. In its current form, I cannot recommend this overpriced product and would strongly advise against buying it.",False,33,3,1734820946

This makes it hard for anyone who doesn’t like both genres equally to see it as a positive aspect.  If the starting point and destination in the racing mode were connected to the camp in the Vampire mode, it might have been more immersive.  Still, considering its price, it’s an impressive indie game that delivers decent value for money.
